1479810,Legendary Hoplite,,,,0,0,0,,,,,"OverviewOriginally developed for the seven day roguelike challenge, Hoplite follows many genre and setting conventions laid down in Rogue and its successors. It was rebuilt by Magma Fortress for Android and iOS with new art, sound, abilities and achievements. With a goal to retrieve the Fleece of Yendor from the 16th floor, players descend a dungeon filled with demons and wizards. Every death restarts the player at the beginning of the game, and every floor is randomized. Most floors have Altars where players can pray to Apollo, Hermes, Athena and other gods to either regain health or gain ability upgrades, like throwing the spear further or regaining energy with each kill. GameplayBoth the player and the enemies can only move once per turn, and moving is the main form of attacking for most units. The basic form of attack, the stab, is done by moving adjacent to an enemy.Having a spear allows the player to lunge by moving directly towards the enemy (being adjacent doesn't count). Alternatively, players can throw the spear by selecting the item in the bottom right hand corner and choosing a target. Players will need to retrieve it unless they have a special ability.Leaping costs 50 energy (players gain 10 for moving adjacent an enemy) and it can be combined with other abilities.Players also have a shield, which can be used to bash enemies or bombs one space away in the direction that the player character is facing.Players can pray at altars to upgrade their abilities, however, this will remove access to a score bonus. More upgrades can be unlocked by completing Achievements.Once the Fleece of Yendor is retrieved from Depth 16, players can either return to the surface via a portal to end the game, or continue descending to increase their score. When wearing the fleece you regenerate 1 health whenever you descend a floor.  Abilities & UpgradesPlayers can pray at the Altars they find. Praying allows them to refill Health or select one of the following options. Note that players can pray during combat, but it does cost one turn. Many abilities require Sacrifice, which reduces the maximum health by 1, 2 or 3.Keep in mind: there are no altars beyond Depth 15. Should descend beyond where the fleece is kept, you do so with no more prayers.HealthPlayers begin with 3 health and take 1 damage from any enemy attack. Many Ability Upgrades require health to be sacrificed in order to equip them.Divine RestorationHeals the player completelyFortitudeIncreases maximum health by 1ProtectionBecome temporarily invulnerable after taking damageSacrifice required: 2 HealthAchievement required: FlawlessMove and StabAny time the player moves adjacent to an enemy that is already nearby, they will get stabbed. Stabbing does not work when moving directly towards an enemy - that requires a Spear.SpearLunge by moving directly towards, rather than adjacent to, an enemy.

Mastiff eventually published Gurumin in the United States on the PSP in 2007 as well as the PC in 2015 and finally the Nintendo 3DS in 2016 with a new port created by Mastiff.StoryA girl named Parin is sent to live with her grandfather Hyperbolic when her parents set out on an excavation. Parin stumbles across another child in Tiese Town after being told there were no other children in town. This child is being attacked by a dog and is then saved by Parin.After saving the other little girl, Parin finds out that this girl is not a human, but a monster. Only kids can see these monsters and villagers in Tiese Town think she is talking to herself.After saving the monster named Pino, Parin is then introduced to her brother Puku. Puku decides to let Parin visit their home of the Monster Village. Monster Village is attacked by phantoms while Parin is in the Potato Ruins and she must help the inhabitants rebuild.TriviaGurumin was the first fully 3D game to be developed by Nihon Falcom and its graphics engine would live on at the company for a very long time. During a 2020 interview with Gamer, Toshihiro Kondo revealed that the company's current 3D engine originated from Gurumin which they had been updating and modifying for years. While not all of the company's games used this technology, with some titles instead using Sony's PhyreEngine, Falcom had basically been creating games with a version of Gurumin's engine for over 15 years before finally creating a new engine, which debuted with Kuro no Kiseki in 2021.",,,,,,,,,

1480270,Sethtek Driving Simulator Playtest,0,,,0,0,1,,,,,"Dangerous Driving is an arcade racing game in the same vein as the Burnout series. The game consists of a handful of different environments broken up into circuits and point to point races and numerous types of cars to drive during events. Game types include standard races, road rage, time attack, and pursuit. Game mechanics are essentially identical to the Burnout games; players build boost by drifting, driving in oncoming traffic, near misses, jumps, and takedowns. Cars will crash if they hit a road car or a piece of the environment, and for a short period of time after a crash the player is able to enter an aftertouch window and attempt to hit another player car with limited movement.EnvironmentsThe game features 7 unique locations inspired by national parks in North America. These locations provide the game's combined 31 courses with over 270 miles of road.Twin Ferry LakesDead Rock CanyonSurfside IslandEagle Ridge MountainHigh Dunes DesertGrasslands Proving GroundCool Water ValleyGame ModesAt launch the single player mode will have 69 (nice) events made up from the 9 different event types. New cars are unlocked by progressing through the single player.RaceThe standard event type in Dangerous Driving. A race against 5 computer controller vehicles with Takedowns and Aftertouch active.HeatwaveA more pure race mode where Takedowns are not active, and completely using the boost bar will trigger a ""Heatwave""; an automatic refill of the boost bar allowing for chaining of boosts. Think of this as the Burnout 1/2 mode.Face OffA one on one event with a rival vehicle. Take them down, win the race, and win their car!ShakedownA pure time trial mode with players racing against the clock to get the best time possible. These events will also serve as a preview for cars yet unlocked.EliminatorA five lap race in which last place is eliminated every lap.GPA three race series in which points are earned and the champion is determined at the end. There is a GP series for every Class of vehicle.SurvivalA combination of time trial and checkpoint racing. The longer a player goes the tighter the window for the next checkpoint will be and traffic will become heavier.PursuitPlay as a cop and takedown the bad guys before they escape!Road RageGet as many Takedowns as possible before time runs out.VehiclesDangerous Driving technically has 27 vehicles across six different classes. That being said, it appears as though there are really only six unique car models, corresponding to the classes, that are then tuned and modified for every variant.ClassesSedanSUVCoupeSupercarHypercarFormula DDVariantsBase - The one you start each class of events with.Advanced - Stronger versions that made for Takedowns and Road Rage.Tuned - Faster cars tuned for Heatwave events that earn boost faster, and gain 2 MPH to their top speed after every Heatwave.Prototype - Optimized for racing, these vehicles are tuned to be faster but more fragile.Cop Cars - Sedan, SUV, and Supercar cop cars for all of your pursuit needs.",,,,,,,,,

Players take on the roles of either Mar-T or Chip, two robots who have been stranded on an alien planet by the dreaded Krofax race. Early in their adventure, Mar-T and Chip come across an abandoned spaceship which houses Con-Rad, the ship's computer (voiced by Simon Pegg). Con-Rad essentially acts as the player's guide, leading them to ship parts that will rebuild the ship to a functional state, allowing them to leave the harsh planet and their dangerous inhabitants.GameplayThe rocket boots abilityThe gameplay in Spare Parts is centered around players cooperatively exploring the alien world while using upgradeable abilities, such as power arms and rocket boots, to overcome obstacles and find their way to safety. As with many co-op games, Spare Parts can be played either locally on the same console or online. There are ""co-op only"" abilities and interactions that are only available to two players, giving an strong incentive to experience the game with another player. However, the game can still be played single-player, but unlike most co-op oriented games, it will not feature an AI companion. If players do choose to play cooperatively, they can receive bonuses for simultaneously combining and using certain weapons.In addition to Mar-T and Chip, other robots have crash-landed or been abandoned on the planet. The players can choose to rescue and repair these robots and unlock them as playable characters.Server ShutdownOn April 13th 2012, only 15 months after the game was released, the online servers for the game were shut down. No online co-op play was possible after this, although owners of the game can still play co-op locally.",,,,,,,,,

Gameplay stresses exploration, discovery, narrative, and even introspection by the player and the player's character.The story of the game draws heavilly on the classic fairy tale, Little Red Riding Hood. The player begins by choosing from six playable sisters, each in very different stages of life: Robin, Rose, Ginger, Ruby, Carmen, and Scarlet. The player must then make their way to Grandmother's house, guided by a forest path. Following the path results in an uneventful ""good ending"", and a quick close to the game, but deviating from the path and exploring the dark forest reveals many secrets.AwardsAt the 2008 Independent Games Festival The Path was nominated for the Excellence in Visuals Arts award.

A subsequent expansion to the game, titled 'The Dead and the Drunk' was released on the 14th of December 2020. The expansion was delivered as a free update to anyone that owns the game on PC via GOG or Steam.The game is set in an alternate-history version of World War II and starts with the main characters crash landing behind enemy lines. In the crash, the leadership dies and the chain of command is broken, leaving the squad members (and the player) with no idea as to where they were traveling to in the first place and why. GameplayWeGo Turn based MechanicsUnlike traditional turn-based games, Broken Lines uses a WeGo system to handle the gameplay. In this system, the game is split into two distinct phases, the planning phase and the action phase.During the planning phase, both the player and the opponent gives their troops commands on what to do. Once the commands are given, the player watches eight seconds of the game play out in real time, where they see the squad execute on the orders that were given, and if enemy units are present, what the enemies do.During the action phase the player cannot give new commands, however the exception is if new contact was made with an enemy. In that case, the action phase breaks and the player can give new commands to their troops.Whatever happens, when the eight seconds of the action phase ends, the real time segment comes to an end and the planning phase begins again.

It was released in Japan on December 8, 2016. The game takes place in Tokyo in the series staple Kamurocho district and the fictional coastal town Onomichi Jingaicho, Hiroshima. This game is the first to feature the Dragon Engine, which allows for streamlined combat, highly-improved graphics, and new physics that allow characters to make greater use of the environment while in game.StoryAfter the events of Yakuza 5, Kiryu finds himself imprisoned for three years. When he returns to the orphanage at the end of his sentence, he discovers that Haruka has gone missing from the orphanage. Following her trail to Kamurocho, Kiryu finds the city once again embroiled in violence, as the Japanese Tojo Clan, Chinese Saio Triad, and Korean Jingweon Mafia are all fighting for control over the city. On top of that, Kiryu discovers that Haruka was hospitalized in a hit-and-run accident, and that she has an infant son named Haruto.Kiryu ends up taking care of Haruto himself while trying to track down the father of the baby, but the path takes him between Kamurocho and the port town of Onomichi in Hiroshima, all while the Yakuza and other criminal groups are trying to use the legendary Dragon of Dojima for their own gain. Who is Haruto's real father? Why was Haruka nearly killed in a hit-and-run? And what is the secret of Onomichi that many have died to protect?CombatYakuza 6's new engine comes packed with a brand new combat system that tries to mix elements from the different combat styles of Yakuza 0 into a singular style. An Ultimate Heat Mode has been added: Functioning similarly to that of Yakuza 3's Red Heat, which allows Kiryu to perform brutal finishers. Similar to previous games in the series, Kiryu can use a mix of light and heavy attacks to create combos and damage enemies. By attacking a heat meter can be built up and this allows the player to use heat moves which are more powerful attacks with unique animations.Clan CreatorPartway through the story, Kiryu finds himself embroiled in a fight with ""JUSTIS,"" a clan of violent youths in Kamurocho led by the mysterious ""Rainmaker"" who started out trying to fight back against the color gangs but ended up becoming worse after the color gangs were defeated. In both Onomichi and Kamrocho, Kiryu and Joe must raise an army to destroy the evil of JUSTIS, the Kiryu-kai (""Kiryu Clan"").In-game, the player uses a pseudo-RTS setup, mixing named ""elites"" with a near-endless stream of nameless soldiers to destroy members of the opposing gang.ClassesBrawler: Standard fighter who runs up and punches enemies.Gunner: Suited man who carries a pistol for long-range attacks, won't last long at close range.Heavy: Slow, hulking brute who is slightly more resistant to normal attacks.Rusher: Nimble fighters with knives who can quickly cut through opponents but are very fragile.Grenadier: They take a long time to throw grenades which can heavily damage and knock back anyone caught in the blast, even Elites.System RequirementsPCPC MinimumPC RecommendedOperating System: Windows 10Processor: Intel Core i5-3470 | AMD FX-6300Memory: 4 GB RAMGraphics: Nvidia GeForce GTX 660, 2 GB | AMD Radeon HD 7870, 2 GBDirectX: Version 11Storage: 40 GB available spaceAdditional Notes: Requires a CPU which supports the AVX and SSE4.2 instruction setOperating System: Windows 10Processor: Intel Core i7-6700 | AMD Ryzen 5 2600Memory: 6 GB RAMGraphics: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070, 8 GB | AMD Radeon RX Vega 56, 8 GBDirectX: Version 11Storage: 40 GB available spaceAdditional Notes: Requires a CPU which supports the AVX and SSE4.2 instruction set External LinksYakuza 6: The Song of Life Official Site",,,,,,,,,

The player that gets high points starts the game. His opponent can make a step only after the previous player finishes the step. After the first step ends a player with high points throws all 5 bones. If there are any combinations that can add points to the player, the player takes out those bones and throws the rest of bones. When the game starts both players have to get 70 points to record results. If a player gets 70 points or more he/she can save the round score and add it to the main score by passing a move to another player. After a player saves 70 points he/she can write down any amount of points that the player gets during the round. If the player gets points from all of 5 bones then this player can throw them again. This action might be repeated again and again until the player gets points or gets no combinations. A player can record the round score if last action of the player was take some points. If a player throw bones and does not take something all the round score will not be counted. Situation called ""trousers"".

1478210,Scramble,299,Nyberius,Nyberius,0,0,0,"Casual, Indie, Strategy","English, Turkish, German",,,"OverviewScramble is a side-scrolling shooter originally developed by Konami for the arcade. The game predates Gradius, and shares many qualities with that classic franchise.Scramble is a side-scrolling shooter with forced scrolling. It was the first scrolling shooter to offer multiple, distinct levels. The game is thus credited with setting the template for most of the side-scrolling shooters that followed its release.GameplayScramble's second stageScramble is a horizontal shooter played using a four-way joystick and two buttons that control the forward guns and bombs. The game has six stages, and in each stage the player must navigate a gauntlet of enemies. The environment is also a considerable hazard as the terrain can be difficult to navigate with the slow ship. Additionally, the ship is constantly running out of fuel, and must refuel on the fly by destroying fuel tanks that litter the stages. The final stage requires the player to finish a tricky bombing run, which if they fail, they must repeat the stage. After finishing the last level, the game loops back to the first stage and plays again at a higher difficulty level where the ship runs out of fuel more quickly.LegacyArcade flyerScramble was ported to many different home game systems and computers, both legally and as illegal clones. It was the subject of an important intellectual property case (Stern Electronics, Inc. v. Kaufman, 669 F.2d 852) where it was ruled that Stern Electronics Inc. (the game's publisher in North America) could copyright the images and sounds in a game and not just the game's source code.Sequels and Relation To GradiusThe arcade game Super Cobra could be called a sequel to Scramble, as it shares basically the same game mechanic as the original. Scramble is also cited as a predecessor to Gradius in both the introduction to Gradius Galaxies on the Game Boy Advance and the Gradius Breakdown bonus DVD included with Gradius V; however, Konami disputed the relation in their guide for the Gradius Portable collection on PSP. Although Scramble may now not be part of the official Gradius continuum, it's easy to see how some of the features of Scramble, such as independently-fired weapons and hazardous terrain, were further developed for Gradius.",,,,,,,,,

1478260,City of Rampage,0,Zhengis Tasbolatov,Zhengis Tasbolatov,0,0,0,Action,"English, Russian",,,"OverviewRetro City Rampage is a 2D indie deliberately-retro open-world action-adventure game developed and published digitally by Vblank for the PC (via Steam and GOG), PlayStation 3, and PlayStation Vita (both via the PlayStation Network) on October 9, 2012.Inspired by the Grand Theft Auto franchise, players control a character from a high top-down perspective with the intent to cause as much mayhem (and other criminal activity) in the large city as possible. The game is stylized to resemble games from 8-bit consoles (such as the Nintendo Entertainment System and Sega Master System), with careful attention to detail (including a restrictive, yet customizable, color palette). The game also features numerous homages to (and parodies of) video games and other pop culture of the 1980s (and early 1990s). A 16-bit sequel, titled Shakedown Hawaii, is still in development.Players control The Player, a small-time thug-for-hire working as a henchman (for criminal mastermind The Jester) in the city of Theftropolis. During a bank heist gone wrong, Player finds a time-traveling telephone booth, which transports him to the future (circa year 20XX). With the time machine broken, Player must help Doc Choc (a scientist who mistakes the Player for a time-traveling hero) gather the parts needed to repair the time machine while doing other odd jobs, avoiding law enforcement, and foiling the plans of Doc's rival, Dr. Von Buttnik.The game was later released for the Xbox 360 (via Xbox Live Arcade by D3 on January 2, 2013) and Wii (via WiiWare on February 28, 2013). It later received an enhanced port for the Nintendo 3DS (released on the eShop on February 6, 2014) as Retro City Rampage DX, adding new gameplay mechanics and visual effects. These changes were brought over to other platforms on November 2014. While it was updated for free for the PC, XB360, and Wii versions (with the PC version adding support for the Mac and, on July 29, 2015, Linux platforms), the PSN version required a separate purchase (with added support for the PlayStation 4). This version was later released for iOS devices (on March 10, 2016), the PlayStation Portable (also via PSN on July 19, 2016), and Android devices (on December 13, 2016).A unique port of the game was digitally released on July 29, 2015, free for owners of the PC version, that is supported on early-'90s MS-DOS computers. Titled Retro City Ransom 486, it is designed to install from a single floppy disk and contains most of the original game's features intact (notably losing digital sounds and music but adding DOS joystick support). A prototype version for Windows 3.1 was released alongside this version. Alongside the digital release, this version also received a limited-edition paid boxed release (with the game's installation files on a working floppy disk).GameplayRCR is an open world game in the style of Grand Theft Auto, and the player is free to go wherever they want to at any time. The map shows blips where missions can be started, either story missions (blue) or side missions (yellow). If the player commits any crime while a police officer is nearby, they will chase down the player, and as his crimes escalate, more police will gradually chase him, with the army intervening with tanks at the highest wanted level. Health is replenished by either picking up hearts or buying food from vending machines.The story missions have a range of gameplay. Some missions play like classic NES games, for example one of the first missions plays like Paperboy, where the player has to deliver leaflets by throwing them into mail boxes. Other missions are similar to ones found in GTA games, such as travelling to the other side of town to kill a target, or tailing a car.There are also minigames; Nolan's Arcade, named after Atari founder Nolan Bushnell, features a light version of Bit.Trip Runner and a 'test your might' game like the one from Mortal Kombat. When driving a taxi, players can start a taxi driving minigame. Spread across the map are 'rampage' icons where the player has to cause as much damage as possible with a specific weapon in a limited amount of time.Player's appearance can be customised. There are numerous shops around town where players can get a new haircut, tattoos, sunglasses, or even a 'face transplant' to look like the game's developers, or other real life personalities ranging from fellow indie developers to even some games journalists.AestheticAs the title of the game suggests, Retro City Rampage has a deliberately retro look to its design that evokes games of the 8-bit era. The game's title is even patterned after that of the NES game River City Ransom. Retro City Rampage also references other titles of the era, such as a stage that resembles the second stage of Contra, but from the top-down perspective.Display FiltersThe game can be made to look like various game consoles, such as the Super Game Boy.Retro City Rampage allows users to use a range of display filters which pay homage to classic gaming machines:Entertainment SystemEntertainment NightBlurst ProcessorAtaroVision 2599SEE=64Granny SmithPC DOS EGAPC DOS CGA APC DOS CGA BPC DOS MDAPC WIN16XZ MoonbeamBlack & White TVPocket HandheldBrick HandheldVirtual BurnRCRWeaponsThe game features a wide variety of weapons ranging from fists, all the way to an NES style light gun.

Doc Choc's appearance is very similar to Doc Brown from the Back to The Future films, and appropriately his car resembles the infamous DeLorean. A lot of these references also appear indirectly as shop names and billboards. There are also place names in the game, such as Granville Zone, that are named after real locations in Vancouver, the developer's home town, as well as an area called 'Primate Peninsula'.System RequirementsMinimumOS: Windows XP/Vista/ 7Processor: 1.8 GHzRAM: 512MB (1 GB recommended)Graphics: 3D graphics card compatible with DirectX 9.0c,HDD: 50 MB",,,,,,,,,

Tank! is a third-person vehicular combat game developed and released by Namco Bandai for arcades in late 2009 (October in Japan, December in North America).A spiritual sequel to the 1995 Namco arcade game Tokyo Wars, Tank! Tank! Tank! pits four players (human or A.I.) against each-other as quick-moving combat tanks in wide-open destructible arenas. Along with a variety of weapon power-ups (from a standard Machine Gun to the single-use Colossus Missile), the game features an optional co-operative mode where players fight a variety of giant monsters. The dedicated sit-down arcade machines (which are linked together) feature heavy use of force feedback and ""NAM-CAM"" camera support (for player avatars, previously a feature in the Mario Kart Arcade GP series).The game was later ported to the Wii U and released in two forms: one as a complete retail release and one as a downloadable free-to-play release (with DLC for levels and game modes). Along with local split-screen multiplayer for up to four players (with one player using the Wii U Gamepad), this version adds new maps, tank types, and game modes (including a Story Mode and an asymmetrical multiplayer mode using the Gamepad).The retail release was a launch title for the Wii U in North America and Europe (November 18, 2012 and November 30, 2012, respectfully), with the downloadable version released in early 2013. The Japanese version swapped release dates, with the downloadable version released on December 26, 2012 and the retail version in February 21, 2013.GameplayMultiplayer Gameplay.Each player controls a tank and can compete in 3 different game modes. Players control their tanks using a steering wheel and forward and reverse pedals. Both the seat and the steering wheel shake when firing a shot or being struck by one. The game includes multiple power ups for your tank, including the Plasma Bolt, Machine Gun, Missile Rack, Colossus Missile, and Mega-Beam. Before the start of each match, each player can have their picture taken by a camera included with the cabinet or the Wii U gamepad and choose one of many different costume overlays to include with it.ModesCo-op: All players work together to take down a series of giant monsters, culminating in a battle against King Ghidora-esque 3 headed robot dragon.Free-for-All: Players fight against each other in one of two different settings. The player who destroys the most tanks during the time limit wins.Team Battle: Players split up into two different teams and fight for supremacy.My Kong ( Wii U Only ): One player takes control of a large gorilla monster via use of the Gamepad while up to 3 other players using the standard tank attempt to destroy them.Wii UThe Wii U version of the game is played with the Wii U gamepad and Wii remotes. Tanks are controlled with the Wii remote. Players hold the remote horizontally in their hands, using the directional pad to move their tank around while hitting A to fire. Players lock on to their targets and can destroy the environment to dig up upgrades that increase their fire power or armor.In multiplayer, one player uses the Wii U gamepad to control the level's boss. The player uses the controller's screen to control their character and can tap the screen to unleash powerful attacks such as devastating stomps and barrages of missiles. The front facing camera of the controller lets players put their face into the game as the boss's face.",,,,,,,,,

It also received a retail release in Europe sometime after.A spin-off of the Euro Truck Simulator series, and the sibling to Euro Truck Simulator 2, American Truck Simulator brings the series' driving simulation and trucking company management to the United States of America (which was previously the setting to the studio's earlier 18 Wheels of Steel series). Much of the gameplay and interface remain the same, as players can customize the game's simulation aspects, purchase and customize their own trucks and trucking business, and improve their reputation to receive better-paying deliveries.The game was originally released with the West Coast state of California as the sole locale (with Nevada as free day-one DLC) and two trucks (the Kenworth T680 and the Peterbilt 579). Additional states, as well as additional cargo types and truck accessories, were periodically added as expansions and DLC for sale. Similar to Euro Truck Simulator 2, the game has received numerous post-release updates, including revamped locales, additional truck models, gameplay improvements, and updates to the user interface.TrucksFreightliner Cascadia  International LT International LoneStar  Kenworth T 680Kenworth W900  Mack Anthem   Peterbilt 389Peterbilt 579 Volvo VNL  Western Star 49X Kenworth:Kenworth T 680Kenworth W900Peterbilt:Peterbilt 579Peterbilt 389Volvo:Volvo VNLInternational:International LoneStar International LTMack:Mack AnthemWestern StarWestern Star 49XMap RescaleWhen SCS started development on American Truck simulator, there was a small team of 4 people working on it. Due to the fact, they decided to to scale the map smaller than the map in Euro Truck Simulator 2. Now that game has successfully launched, SCS is continuing development with a larger team and listening to customer feed back. On June 23, 2016, SCS announced that they where working on scaling up the map from 1:35 to 1:20. (Same scale as Euro Truck Simulator 2) The recasle was released as part of the 1.5 game update on December 12, 2016.1:35 scale (Highlighted in yellow) compared to the new 1:20 scale. Roads highlighted in yellow show how they where extended to meet the new scale.DLCMap expansionsNevada: was released as Free day 1 DLC when the game launched.

1476950,Planetary Control!,499,Kerberos Productions,Kerberos Productions,0,0,0,"Casual, Indie, Strategy",English,,,"OverviewControl is third-person action game developed by Remedy Entertainment, known for such titles as Max Payne and Alan Wake, and published by 505 Games for PC, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4.The story centers around protagonist Jesse Faden who in the process of searching for her lost brother is drawn to the titular Federal Bureau of Control, a government agency residing in a supernatural structure called The Oldest House in the middle of New York. Moments after entering the building Jesse becomes entwined in an hostile takeover raging inside the agency between the agents and the mysterious Hiss. Through the ensuing conflict and pursuit of her sibling she uncovers both secrets about the bureau as well as her own past.GameplayControl continues Remedy's tradition of fast paced action shooters that heavily favor movement as the game does not include any sort of cover system. With a non-regenerating health bar that can only be topped off by collecting blue bits from shot enemies, the player is actively encouraged to stay in the thick of combat with a risk reward system of healing through dealing damage. The inclusion of supernatural abilities helps add another dimension to the classic gunplay. Jesse initially starts out with just the Service Weapon, a supernatural firearm that can shift into different forms taking on archetypal properties of a pistol, shotgun or machine gun among others. Interestingly Remedy decided on foregoing traditional ammo pickups in service of regenerating ammo. As Jesse progresses through the game she is able to obtain various supernatural abilities which similarly work on a regenerating system. Having both weapons effectively on varying cooldowns creates a natural rhythm of switching off between abilities and firearm. Both weapon and abilities can be upgraded throughout the game as well as augmented with Mods via random enemy drops or a simple crafting system.Another new development for Remedy is a non-linear approach to level design. Past games like Max Payne or Quantum Break were linear experiences that funneled the player from encounter to encounter. Through the Oldest House, Control introduces an open-world design that allows the player to explore the bureau and take on side activities in additional to their primary objective. The level design uses keycards in increasing security levels as a way of gating access to different divisions of the bureau, as well as natural obstacles that can only be overcome through the use of specific abilities. Plenty of NPCs that Jesse meets along the way will have unique missions that feature bespoke content that can optionally be completed. In order to fuel the crafting system there are also Bureau Alerts that function like randomly generated combat encounters - the bureau is constantly under attack from the Hiss and these special targets will reward the player with Mod drops and crafting materials.

1476980,The Tower Of TigerQiuQiu Tiger Tank 63,99,TigerQiuQiu,TigerQiuQiu,0,0,0,"Action, Casual, Indie",English,,,"OverviewTank! Tank! Tank! is a third-person vehicular combat game developed and released by Namco Bandai for arcades in late 2009 (October in Japan, December in North America).A spiritual sequel to the 1995 Namco arcade game Tokyo Wars, Tank! Tank! Tank! pits four players (human or A.I.) against each-other as quick-moving combat tanks in wide-open destructible arenas. Along with a variety of weapon power-ups (from a standard Machine Gun to the single-use Colossus Missile), the game features an optional co-operative mode where players fight a variety of giant monsters. The dedicated sit-down arcade machines (which are linked together) feature heavy use of force feedback and ""NAM-CAM"" camera support (for player avatars, previously a feature in the Mario Kart Arcade GP series).The game was later ported to the Wii U and released in two forms: one as a complete retail release and one as a downloadable free-to-play release (with DLC for levels and game modes). Along with local split-screen multiplayer for up to four players (with one player using the Wii U Gamepad), this version adds new maps, tank types, and game modes (including a Story Mode and an asymmetrical multiplayer mode using the Gamepad).The retail release was a launch title for the Wii U in North America and Europe (November 18, 2012 and November 30, 2012, respectfully), with the downloadable version released in early 2013. The Japanese version swapped release dates, with the downloadable version released on December 26, 2012 and the retail version in February 21, 2013.GameplayMultiplayer Gameplay.Each player controls a tank and can compete in 3 different game modes. Players control their tanks using a steering wheel and forward and reverse pedals. Both the seat and the steering wheel shake when firing a shot or being struck by one. The game includes multiple power ups for your tank, including the Plasma Bolt, Machine Gun, Missile Rack, Colossus Missile, and Mega-Beam. Before the start of each match, each player can have their picture taken by a camera included with the cabinet or the Wii U gamepad and choose one of many different costume overlays to include with it.ModesCo-op: All players work together to take down a series of giant monsters, culminating in a battle against King Ghidora-esque 3 headed robot dragon.Free-for-All: Players fight against each other in one of two different settings. The player who destroys the most tanks during the time limit wins.Team Battle: Players split up into two different teams and fight for supremacy.My Kong ( Wii U Only ): One player takes control of a large gorilla monster via use of the Gamepad while up to 3 other players using the standard tank attempt to destroy them.Wii UThe Wii U version of the game is played with the Wii U gamepad and Wii remotes. Tanks are controlled with the Wii remote. Players hold the remote horizontally in their hands, using the directional pad to move their tank around while hitting A to fire. Players lock on to their targets and can destroy the environment to dig up upgrades that increase their fire power or armor.In multiplayer, one player uses the Wii U gamepad to control the level's boss. The player uses the controller's screen to control their character and can tap the screen to unleash powerful attacks such as devastating stomps and barrages of missiles. The front facing camera of the controller lets players put their face into the game as the boss's face.",,,,,,,,,

You can play through the game single player or offline co-op, leveling up your character as you progress. The player can use light, heavy, and jump attacks as well as ""hero abilities"" and objects in the environment to take down enemies. A dash move is incorporated as the only defensive measure.Characters and AbilitiesKick-assKick-AssKick-ass is a melee-only fighter, using his fists for his light attack and his batons as his heavy attack. Players will want to consistently use the jump attack to close in on distant enemies. His hero abilities consist of a damaging swing with his bats as well as a ""rage mode"" in which he slowly regenerates health.Hit-GirlHit-GirlHit-Girl uses her double-ended blade as her light attack and akimbo pistols as her heavy attack. She also possesses the ability to perform a vertical wall run by running at a wall and jumping just before impact. Her first hero ability has her performing a deadly move with her blades, while she jumps in the air and madly shoots her pistols for the second.Big DaddyBig DaddyKnives and a shotgun are employed by Big Daddy for his light and heavy attacks, respectively. His shotgun has a shorter range than Hit-Girl's pistols, but is very damaging at close range. He throws frag and flash-bang grenades as his hero abilities.UpgradesAs the player defeats enemies, he or she is given experience points (additional experience points can be found by destroying what looks like giant backpacks full of coke). After enough of these experience points have been collected, the player levels up (there are 50 levels) and is given two or three points that can be used to upgrade the current character's ""defense,"" ""attack,"" and ""special"" ratings. This decreases damage taken, increases damage given, and decreases the amount of hero bar the hero abilities use, respectively.Other ModesCompleting the game in normal mode unlocks Extreme and Arena modes. Extreme mode is the same campaign as normal mode, but the enemies have been beefed up to challenge leveled-up characters. Arena mode drops the player into one of three areas, fighting seemingly endless waves of all types of enemies. At the end of each wave, health crates are dropped across the arena, disappearing at the start of the next wave.",,,,,,,,,

1477290,Poet Squad,,,,0,0,0,,,,,"OverviewSquad is a tactical First Person Shooter set in modern day with real world armies, it is a spiritual sequel to the Project Reality modification for Battlefield 2 and is being developed by Offworld Industries (OWI), a team made up of former PR developers. Squad is using Unreal Engine 4.Squad features 100 player servers, deployable assets and vehicles with a strong focus on gameplay elements that emphasize realism, communication and teamwork without sacrificing accessibility.The game was funded with Kickstarter and was released in on Steam Early Access on December 14th, 2015. The full 1.0 release of the game was on September 23rd, 2020.GameplayUS soldiers advancing.Squad is a modern military, class based FPS where two opposing teams battle it out in a variety of game modes. The game features infantry based combat supplemented by armored vehicles, players will be able to drive tanks and pilot helicopters.The developers are seeking to bridge the gap between arcade style shooters such as Battlefield and military simulators like ArmA.Squad features 50 vs. 50 team battles, each team can be divided in to 9 squads of up to 9 players each, there will be a Commander mode as well.While Squad takes a lot of inspiration from its roots in Project Reality: BF2, the game also features several new concepts that weren't possible with the BF2 engine. These include full body awareness, leaning, weapon sway and the ability to drag fallen teammates in to safety.Militia, an irregular army.Squad's HUD is minimalistic and only displays essential information such as the compass in the bottom of the screen, there is no mini-map and nor any ammo count for weapons, only the amount of magazines left.Infantry movement, stances and stamina influences weapon sway but the player can hold his breath in order to stabilize the weapon for a short period of time. There is also momentum to the player's movement while sprinting.Because teamwork is a prime focus of the game, there is a asset claiming system in place, meaning only Squad leaders can unlock vehicles for their squad to use.CommunicationSince success in Squad relies heavily on teamwork and coordination, there are several ways for the commander, squad leaders (SL) and grunts to talk to their teammates over VoIP, these methods include:Global squad leader channel where SL & Commander can talk to all other SL simultaneously.Squad leader channel where SL & Commander can talk to a specific SL using Numpad 1-9.Squad channel where SL and his members can talk to each other.Local positional speech for talking to teammates in close proximity.Local positional speech can not be heard by the enemy team, OWI noted that this will only result in trolling and will make people use team text chat or external VoIP software instead.Deployables, logistics and spawn systemThere are three different ways to spawn in on the map.Main BaseThe original spawn point where the whole team can spawn in, it is the only spawn point available at the start of the round and can't be disabled by either team.Forward Operating Base (FOB)A small Russian FOB and APC.FOBs are player constructed spawn points where the whole team can spawn in. Squad leaders can put down framework for deployable assets (such as Barbed wire, Hesco walls, Mortar pits and Heavy Machinegun nests) near the FOB which then can be built by other players with Entrenching tools.FOBs can only be constructed 400 meters apart.FOBs will only become active after a couple of minutes unless supplies have been dropped off by a logistics vehicle.Rally point (RP)Rally points can be placed by a Squad leader and is limited to his squad, each squad can only have one RP active at a time. Rally points can be placed if the SL has got a few members nearby but will disappear if enemies are close. For each placement, the RP can be used nine times.Kit role systemM203 Grenade launcher on a M4, used by the US Army Grenadier role.Squad features a Kit role system with many different types of classes to choose from. Since the game is based around real world conflicts, players are only be able to use standard issue gear. There is some amount of weapon customization however, such as different types of sights and attachments.Many of the kits require two or more people to be in the same squad, if a player leaves or is kicked out of a squad then he will loose his current kit and receive a ""Recruit"" kit instead.There's a limit to how many of each kit can be in a squad and on the team.Command & Support rolesSquad leaderEngineerMedicSquad rolesRiflemanCrewmanPilotDirect combat rolesAutomatic RiflemanBreacherGrenadierLight Anti-tankMarksmanSpecialist rolesAnti-airHeavy Anti-tankReconnaissanceGame modesAdvance and Secure (AAS)Logistics play a key part in the order of battle, transporting booth troops and supplies.AAS is a conquest style game mode where two opposing teams attack and/or defend locations on the map in a linear or parallel fashion, trying to secure more territory.The areas have to be captured in order and the status of each flag (whether one team has a cap advantage or if it's neutral) decides which locations are in play.Each team start with a set amount of tickets (seen in the top right of the screen), these will start to drain as players die and objectives are lost. The team which tickets drop to zero first looses.Insurgency (INS)Insurgency is an asymmetrical game mode where a conventional force tries to track down and destroy insurgent weapon caches, the location of these are randomized and the conventional force have to gather intelligence (by neutralizing the insurgents) to find each one.The conventional force start with a set amount of tickets similar to the AAS game mode while the insurgent's are unlimited and only need to make sure the caches aren't destroyed.FactionsUS soldier with a LAW.Regular armiesModelled after their real world equivalents, these factions have access to the latest military technology but only standard issue gear.British ArmyRussian ArmyUnited States ArmyIrregular armiesIrregular armies are modelled after various rebel and terrorist groups, they use a wide variety of older equipment but also improvised vehicles and explosives.InsurgentsMilitiaMapsEastern EuropeFool's road (Project Reality remake)GorodokNarvaOperation First LightYehorivkaMiddle EastChoraKohat toiKokan (Project Reality remake)Logar ValleySumari BalaSouthern AsiaAl Basrah (Project Reality remake)Fallujah (Project Reality remake)There's also a training map (Jensen's Range) for practising with various weapons and vehicles.EquipmentInfantry weaponsPistolsBeretta M92FSGlock 17Makarov PMMP-443TT33Submachine gunsPPSh-41Assault riflesM4 and variant: M4A1Kalashnikov AK-74 and variants: AKS-74, AK-74M, AKS-74M, AKS-74UKalashnikov AKM and variants: AKMS, PM MD. 65, AMD 65L85A2Battle riflesG3A3Semi-automatic carbinesSKSLight machine gunsKalashnikov RPK and variants: RPK-74, RPK-74ML110A2M240BM249 SAWPKMPKP PechenegShotgunsBenelli M4KS-23Remington 870Sniper riflesM110 Semi-Automatic Sniper SystemSVD DragunovRocket launchersFGM-148 JavelinM72A7 LAWRPG-26RPG-29RPG-7GrenadesF1 FragIncendiaryL109A1 FragM67 FragM18 SmokeRGD-5 FragRKG-3 Anti-TankMinesTM-62MiscKnifeRemote detonated IEDMounted weaponsMachinegunsBrowning M2A1DshKNSV and variant: NSVTPKTAutocannons2A72 30mmAnti-tankBGM-71 TOWSPG-9 Kopye Recoilless GunAnti-airZU-23 Anti-Aircraft GunMortarsM1937 82mmM252 81mmPodnos 2B14Misc gearAmmunition bagBinocularsEntrenching toolField dressingFirst aid kitPortable ladderVehiclesMotorbikesMINSK 400Light motorisedBRDM-2M1151 Enhanced Armament CarrierTechnicalsMRAPOshkosh M-ATVArmored Personnel CarriersBTR-80 and variant: BTR-82AStryker ICVMT-LB and variant: MT-LBM 6MHelicoptersUH-60M BlackhawkTrucksM939MAN Support vehicleURAL 375-DURAL 4320Development2014Column of US Army humvees.Development on Squad started in 2014 after several developers of the Project Reality: BF2 mod realized that the Project Reality 2 (made by a separate team) game would not see the light of day.Hoping to create a true spiritual sequel to the mod they worked on, these PR:BF2 developers formed Offworld Industries and started to work on Squad, a commercial game using Unreal Engine 4.Squad was announced on October 10th, 2014 with the team showcasing several screenshots and a 12 minute gameplay video of the pre-Alpha state of the project. Offworld Industries planned to start a Kickstarter campaign later that year.In November the developers announced that the crowd-funding campaign had been postponed till 2015.2015On Januray 29th Offworld launched the official website, which confirmed 100 player servers and asset construction.In April the developers launched the game on Steam Greenlight, it reached the #1 spot in two days and got accepted within a week.In May Offworld introduced their first iteration of the Deployables and Kit role systems, they also opened up the test environment and successfully ran their first 100 player server. Later that month they launched their Kickstarter and reached their base goal of $184,000 CAD in five days, the crowdfunding campaign ended on June 27th, reaching $434,805 and two stretch goals.In September Squad moved in to a closed Alpha state, gameplay functionality such as reviving and bleeding were added to the game, later in December the game was made made available on Steam with two more playable factions added.Squad launched on Steam Early Access on December 15th.2016While the game received a steady stream of updates, Squad's internal systems for animations and vehicle handling would have be completely reworked which delayed the introduction of vehicles significantly. Some of Squad's early adopters with AMD CPUs also criticized the game for running poorly on their systems.In early August OWI finally released Alpha version 7 which introduced vehicles to the game.2020On September 23rd, 2020 the game was officially released as the full 1.0 release out of Early Access.ModificationsSquad has supported modding since early Alpha and was the second game to be featured in the Unreal Engine Development kit after ARK.Post Scriptum: The Bloody Seventh is an upcoming stand-alone game which is being developed using Squad's Unreal Engine 4 framework, it is set during World War II and covers the events of Operation Market Garden. It is being developed by a team called Periscope Games. The game will feature combined arms warfare on a large scale between British and German troops.Escalation 1985 is another game which uses some of Squad's coding framework.System RequirementsPCPC MinimumPC RecommendedOperating System: Windows 7 SP1 (x64)Processor: Intel Core i or AMD Ryzen with 4 physical coresMemory: 8 GB RAMGraphics: Geforce GTX 770 or AMD Radeon HD 7970 with at least 4 GB of VRAMDirectX: Version 11Network: Broadband Internet connectionStorage: 55 GB available spaceAdditional Notes: A teamwork oriented mindsetOperating System: Windows 7 SP1 (x64), Windows 8 (x64), Windows 10 (x64)Processor: Intel Core i or AMD Ryzen with 6 physical coresMemory: 16 GB RAMGraphics: Nvidia GTX 1060 or AMD Radeon 570 with at least 6GB of VRAMDirectX: Version 12Network: Broadband Internet connectionStorage: 55 GB available spaceAdditional Notes: A microphone External linksOfficial websiteSteam storeKickstarterProject Reality: BF2",,,,,,,,,

Tank! is a third-person vehicular combat game developed and released by Namco Bandai for arcades in late 2009 (October in Japan, December in North America).A spiritual sequel to the 1995 Namco arcade game Tokyo Wars, Tank! Tank! Tank! pits four players (human or A.I.) against each-other as quick-moving combat tanks in wide-open destructible arenas. Along with a variety of weapon power-ups (from a standard Machine Gun to the single-use Colossus Missile), the game features an optional co-operative mode where players fight a variety of giant monsters. The dedicated sit-down arcade machines (which are linked together) feature heavy use of force feedback and ""NAM-CAM"" camera support (for player avatars, previously a feature in the Mario Kart Arcade GP series).The game was later ported to the Wii U and released in two forms: one as a complete retail release and one as a downloadable free-to-play release (with DLC for levels and game modes). Along with local split-screen multiplayer for up to four players (with one player using the Wii U Gamepad), this version adds new maps, tank types, and game modes (including a Story Mode and an asymmetrical multiplayer mode using the Gamepad).The retail release was a launch title for the Wii U in North America and Europe (November 18, 2012 and November 30, 2012, respectfully), with the downloadable version released in early 2013. The Japanese version swapped release dates, with the downloadable version released on December 26, 2012 and the retail version in February 21, 2013.GameplayMultiplayer Gameplay.Each player controls a tank and can compete in 3 different game modes. Players control their tanks using a steering wheel and forward and reverse pedals. Both the seat and the steering wheel shake when firing a shot or being struck by one. The game includes multiple power ups for your tank, including the Plasma Bolt, Machine Gun, Missile Rack, Colossus Missile, and Mega-Beam. Before the start of each match, each player can have their picture taken by a camera included with the cabinet or the Wii U gamepad and choose one of many different costume overlays to include with it.ModesCo-op: All players work together to take down a series of giant monsters, culminating in a battle against King Ghidora-esque 3 headed robot dragon.Free-for-All: Players fight against each other in one of two different settings. The player who destroys the most tanks during the time limit wins.Team Battle: Players split up into two different teams and fight for supremacy.My Kong ( Wii U Only ): One player takes control of a large gorilla monster via use of the Gamepad while up to 3 other players using the standard tank attempt to destroy them.Wii UThe Wii U version of the game is played with the Wii U gamepad and Wii remotes. Tanks are controlled with the Wii remote. Players hold the remote horizontally in their hands, using the directional pad to move their tank around while hitting A to fire. Players lock on to their targets and can destroy the environment to dig up upgrades that increase their fire power or armor.In multiplayer, one player uses the Wii U gamepad to control the level's boss. The player uses the controller's screen to control their character and can tap the screen to unleash powerful attacks such as devastating stomps and barrages of missiles. The front facing camera of the controller lets players put their face into the game as the boss's face.",,,,,,,,,

The game was released on Steam on Oct. 13, 2015.The game's story elements take the player and a team of ""Crusaders"" through various locales, completing objectives in order to earn extra gold and treasure chests that can sometimes contain loot to further improve the characters.Crusaders of the Lost Idols is a Free to Play game currently supported through microtransactions for treasure chests in a manner similar to Counter-Strike: Global Offensive or the multiplayer portion of Mass Effect 3.GameplaySimilar to many incremental games of its kind, Crusaders of the Lost Idols requires the player to click on monsters to attack them, gather gold on defeat of the monsters and use the gold to buy levels for the clicker player-character or to hire Crusaders that deliver a base amount of damage per second (DPS). The Crusaders can also be leveled, and all characters have certain upgrades at set level milestones that can be purchased with gold to unlock abilities or flat damage boosts to the character or to all members of the party.The Crusaders and the player-character are placed on a side-scrolling landscape in the formation of bowling pins (four in the back row, three in the row to the right, etc.), with a maximum party size of 10 Crusaders or 9 Crusaders and the clicker player character.The party formation is one of the twists Crusaders of the Lost Idols provides in its game. Some characters have upgrades that are only in effect when the party is in a certain formation. For example, Emo Werewolf receives a significant DPS boost when no other human Crusaders are next to him in the formation. Other characters fill familiar RPG roles such as Healer, Tank and Buffer through these formation-based upgrades.This formation setup allows for different combinations that players can use to min-max either base DPS damage or base click damage, to boost certain upgrades, to better prepare for boss battles with damage mitigation and healing, or to farm gold for leveling/upgrading.The progression through the game involves four normal levels with MMO-style quest objectives requiring special item drops or a certain number of monsters killed. The fifth level in each five-level section of the game's map is a boss wave, and upon defeat of the boss a treasure chest will drop that can contain various consumable buffs, items that increase the effectiveness of Crusaders or the CPC, or lump sums of gold.

The game takes place in an alternate history version of the present where global warming has caused various natural disaster to transform the landscape dramatically. As such fuel in this world has become scarce and is used as currency.In addition to the career mode the game also allows players to create their own races anywhere in the wasteland and race online with friends.Game Play:The game is an open world racer containing 5,00 miles of terrain. The world is split up into several zones most of which require stars to unlock. In each zone players start out at a base camp from where they can freely roam around searching for challenges and collectibles. The main goal in the game is to complete career races which earn the player stars. Each race has three difficulty levels and completing each grants players a separate star. To enter most races players usually need a specific vehicle which they have to buy using fuel. Fuel can be won from completing either career races or challenges. Challenges are for the most part, similar to career races although completing them does not get the player any stars, only fuel. Like career races most challenges require certain vehicles although challenges are more plentiful than career races so chances are better that players will be able to find a challenge that they can qualify for.Since the world is so large the game makes a couple of concessions to help players navigate through. Career races, for instance, do not have to be found on the map, and can be selected from the Base camp menu immediately upon unlocking a zone. Furthermore, the game contains helicopter pads throughout where players can fast travel too. Challenges however do need to be discovered in free roam mode before becoming selective.PC System RequirementsOS: Windows Vista (Service Pack 1) / Windows XP (Service Pack 3)Processor: Pentium D @ 3.0GHz or equivalent Athlon 64 X2 CPUMemory: 1GB RAMGraphics: GeForce 7800 / Radeon X1800 with 256 MB of VRAMDirectXÂ®: DirectX 9.0cHard Drive: 6GB Hard Drive spaceSound: DirectX Compatible Sound CardInitial activation requires internet connection; Online play requires log-in to Games for Windows - LIVE; software installations required including Sony DADC SecuROM, Games for Windows - LIVE.

Along with a variety of weapon power-ups (from a standard Machine Gun to the single-use Colossus Missile), the game features an optional co-operative mode where players fight a variety of giant monsters. The dedicated sit-down arcade machines (which are linked together) feature heavy use of force feedback and ""NAM-CAM"" camera support (for player avatars, previously a feature in the Mario Kart Arcade GP series).The game was later ported to the Wii U and released in two forms: one as a complete retail release and one as a downloadable free-to-play release (with DLC for levels and game modes). Along with local split-screen multiplayer for up to four players (with one player using the Wii U Gamepad), this version adds new maps, tank types, and game modes (including a Story Mode and an asymmetrical multiplayer mode using the Gamepad).The retail release was a launch title for the Wii U in North America and Europe (November 18, 2012 and November 30, 2012, respectfully), with the downloadable version released in early 2013. The Japanese version swapped release dates, with the downloadable version released on December 26, 2012 and the retail version in February 21, 2013.GameplayMultiplayer Gameplay.Each player controls a tank and can compete in 3 different game modes.

The player who destroys the most tanks during the time limit wins.Team Battle: Players split up into two different teams and fight for supremacy.My Kong ( Wii U Only ): One player takes control of a large gorilla monster via use of the Gamepad while up to 3 other players using the standard tank attempt to destroy them.Wii UThe Wii U version of the game is played with the Wii U gamepad and Wii remotes. Tanks are controlled with the Wii remote. Players hold the remote horizontally in their hands, using the directional pad to move their tank around while hitting A to fire. Players lock on to their targets and can destroy the environment to dig up upgrades that increase their fire power or armor.In multiplayer, one player uses the Wii U gamepad to control the level's boss. The player uses the controller's screen to control their character and can tap the screen to unleash powerful attacks such as devastating stomps and barrages of missiles. The front facing camera of the controller lets players put their face into the game as the boss's face.",,,,,,,,,

In the core game, the player travels across platforming locations broken into fragments, with the fragments often solidifying into platforms when approached in order to facilitate progress.The balletic protagonist's grace is demonstrated through her traversal and the way she animates when crossing over narrow bridges or fighting enemies. She regularly runs afoul of an evil monarch that has dropped her kingdom into its current chaotic state. The framing story, meanwhile, presents a pregnant woman who is returning to a beach and reminiscing about her childhood. These memories are first represented by the levels and then by a vivid static image that the player must recreate by corralling broken fragments together. These snippets eventually reveal the tale of the woman's unhappy upbringing and her hang-ups about her parents.",,,,,,,,,
1475730,Unity Chan And Cube World!!,0,YEARS,ä¸å½©ç»è²æ¸¸æ,0,0,0,"Action, Casual, Indie, RPG","English, Japanese, Simplified Chinese",,,"OverviewOriginally released in an alpha state on July 2, 2013, Cube World is a procedurally-generated voxel-based RPG for PC. Unlike most other voxel-based games, Cube World intentionally lacks sandbox-style building and destruction elements, instead preferring to focus on traditional RPG mechanics such as exploration and combat.The game features a character creation system with eight races and four combat classes (Mage, Ranger, Rogue, Warrior) to choose from. After creating a character, the player can play alone or with friends. The procedurally-generated world is populated with different environmental biomes, villages, dungeons, NPCs, and events. Players earn gear as they complete quests and explore dungeons, although earned gear is most useful in the region it is obtained in, with permanent upgrades instead coming from artifacts scattered throughout the world.Development TroublesCube World began development in 2011, handled solely by Picroma, a software team comprised of Wolfram (Wollay) von Funck and his wife Sarah. Within a day of the game's alpha release, Cube World was removed from sale on Picroma's website, with Wollay citing server issues caused by launch demand and a supposed DDoS attack. The game briefly returned to sale on July 4, 2013, however it would be removed from sale again by August of the same year, citing more work to be done on the game in anticipation of future releases.In the months following, Wollay continued to post semi-frequent updates about features and developments on the game, although no word was given on when the game would return for sale. As time continued and Wollay's updates became more sparse, before stopping entirely from mid-2017 to January 2019. Many had already begun questioning the development of the game and the likelihood of the game seeing a re-release, a sentiment which only solidified after Wollay's apparent disappearance in 2017.On September 6, 2019, Wollay announced on Twitter that the game would be releasing on Steam before the end of the year, with alpha owners receiving a free Steam key for the game. The game subsequently released on September 30, 2019, now labelled a beta version. The beta release saw a handful of bug fixes leading up to its launch, however no updates on bug fixes or new game features have been released since. Upon launch, many criticized the game's re-launch for lacking many features promised at the time of the game's alpha release, as well as the introduction of land-bound equipment significantly changing the game's progression system.",,,,,,,,,

Skater XL is trying to go for more control of the board by letting the player control the skater with both analog sticks.Control:The player's left foot can be controlled with the left stick and the right foot with the right stick. The A button is used to push forward and B is used to slow down. In the air the skater can rotate the body with the left and right trigger (just like most skateboarding games). The key part here is that it is still possible to turn with either analog stick as long as the skateboard is rolling on the ground. Giving the player immense control over the skater.Levels:Currently the game features 1 level, West L.A. courthouse. It has a nice variety of things to do for grinds, manuals and flip tricks. The level lacks quarter/half pipes and banks.Tricks:Due to the game being in early access it is missing some core skateboarding features like grabs, lip tricks and manual variations. But it's possible to do most most flip tricks, grinds and manuals. These tricks can combined giving the player the ability to do sweet trick combinations.Sound:Currently there is no music in the game but the sound effects are very clean and satisfying. Giving the player great feedback of what's going on.Animations:The animations in the game are very smooth and realistic, however due to the free nature of the flipping mechanics sometimes some odd clipping and foot wrapping happens.Mods:There currently is a very active modding community. Quite a few level mods, skater / board skins and even a replay editor mod have been released already.",,,,,,,,,

Order of Battle: World War II features turn-based, hex-based tactical gameplay set in World War II. It has a 3D game map with detailed animations and effects, over 700 different units, unique commanders that can be attached to the player's units, and 20 different specializations to give a unique feel to the player's army. Order of Battle: World War II also includes multiplayer with up to 4 players using its PBEM++ system and an in-game scenario editor.The game was originally released as Order of Battle: Pacific on April 30, 2015 and included what are now the Rising Sun and U.S. Pacific DLCs. On June 14, 2016, the game was renamed to Order of Battle: World War II and became free to play, with the two original campaigns becoming DLC.Order of Battle: World War II includes the Boot Camp tutorial campaign and allows players to play the first scenario of any DLC campaign. In order for players to unlock the scenario editor and multiplayer with all of the factions, only a single DLC needs to be purchased.GameplaySingle-player modesCampaignPlayers can choose play the Boot Camp campaign and the first scenario of any other campaign for free. Each campaign has a series of linked scenarios that allow a player's core forces to carry over from one to the next. Players can also choose between 5 difficulty levels as listed below under scenario difficulty.Boot Camp: The tutorial, this campaign teaches the player the basics of the game. Players control a group of US recruits in a series of training exercises against another team of US recruits.ScenarioPlayers can play individual scenarios with no core force carryover. A number of additional options are provided for scenario play.Quick Experience: Units gain experience faster than normal, allowing players to obtain elite units within a single scenario.Combat Randomizing: Combat outcome is slightly randomized, thus does not always match the estimated results provided prior to an attack.Custom Starting Force: Allows players to purchase and deploy their own core force instead of using the default force provided by the scenario.Scenario Difficulty: There are five difficulties, I to V, with V being the hardest. Difficulty determines the max unit strength for AI units. These are identical to the ones in campaign play.I: AI max unit strength is 6II: AI max unit strength is 8III: AI max unit strength is 10 (Normal difficulty)IV: AI max unit strength is 12V: AI max unit strength is 13Multiplayer modesHotseatIn hotseat multiplayer, up to 4 players can play in a game on the same device. Players must hand over the controls to the next player when their turn is over.Online PBEM++PBEM++ allows players to play against other players from anywhere in the world over the internet. It requires players to log in to a server in order to play. Play is asynchronous, meaning that both players do not need to be online at the same time; one player can log in, take their turn, and then upload the results to the master server; the server can then notify the other player that it is their turn and that player can take their turn when they are ready.Campaign PlayCampaign mode consists of decisions made on the campaign map, the management of a Core Force, choice of specializations, and scenario play.Campaign MapThe campaign map will display where the campaign is taking place, what territory is controlled by whom, and the next available mission(s) which are represented by pushpins. The campaign map will also allow the player to choose the difficulty level, review any specializations the player may have, and view the player's Core Force.Core ForceUnits purchased during a campaign will be part of the player's Core Force and will be identified on the map by the gold outline of their strength plates. The Core Force will travel with the player throughout the campaign and with the experience they gain throughout the battles, will be the key to victory.Auxiliary units: These are the units that are automatically deployed at the start of a scenario during campaign play and are not part of the player's Core Force. As such these units will not carry over with the player from mission to mission. They are identified by a black outline around the strength plateSpecializationsAt certain points throughout a campaign, a player will be presented with a choice between two specializations. A player may only choose one of the two and will be forced to keep that selection for the remainder of the campaign. Specializations give a player's forces unique abilities and units.Scenario PlayScenario play involves fighting battles and capturing objectives.Briefing and ObjectivesAt the start of most scenarios there will be a briefing sequence which will take the player through the objectives and give the plater a background of the mission. Scenarios will contain two types of objectives, primary and secondary.Primary Objectives: These objectives are mandatory in order to win the scenario.Secondary Objectives: These objectives are optional to complete and doing so will provide bonuses in the current scenario or future scenarios in a campaign.All scenarios will have a turn limit, all primary objectives need to be complete before that limit is over, otherwise the scenario will end in a defeat. Players should also keep in mind that it will not always be possible to complete all secondary objectives within a scenario.Victory & Capture PointsSome hexes will contain flags which mark them as a victory or capture point. There are two types of victory points, primary and secondary, and they are linked to the primary and secondary obectives. Capture points simply represent important locations which can be captured for additional supply and deployment zones, in addition to victory points. When capturing a point, it will take 3 turns before the player will receive supply or before they can deploy from that point. Victory and capture points are represented by the star above the flag.Primary VPs: Marked with a gold star.Secondary VPs: Marked with a silver star.Capture Points (CP): Marked with a bronze star.Hexes & TerritoryAll hexes on the map are controlled by one of the players and can be captured by moving a land or naval unit through them. Air units are unable to capture hexes. The borders of a player's territory are shown by thick red lines which follow the hex edges along the boundary between opposing territories. Hexes with victory or capture points will show the flag of the faction that controls it and isolated hexes of one side containing no units or supply sources will be automatically captured by the enemy if they are completely surrounded.Supply SystemBoth land and air units require a certain amount of supply in order to remain at full efficiency. Without enough supply, units will lose efficiency until their efficiency level matches their supply level. Efficiency level affects how well a unit can defend and attack, their movement, and how quickly they can repair or reinforce.Naval units (excluding carriers) can provide supply by being adjacent to a land hex. Land units draw supply from any land-based supply source or from naval units that are adjacent to a land hex, provided that a player controls the hexes between the unit and the supply sources. Air units draw supply from any airfield on the map, and carrier-based aircraft can also draw supply from aircraft carriers.TerrainAll hexes have a terrain type, and every terrain type has a set of stats that determine its effects on combat. Players can check the stats of a hex by using the terrain information panel.Attacker Combat Factor: Determines the amount of casualties an attacker will inflict on the defender. A higher value means the attacker will inflict more casualties, and a lower value means an attacker will inflict less.Defender Combat Factor: Determines the amount of casualties a defender will inflict on the attacker. Higher is better for the defender, lower is worse for the defender.Cover Rating: The amount of cover that is available from direct fire.Disruption Penalty: The efficiency loss for moving through this terrain.Disembark Penalty: The efficiency loss for disembarking on this terrain.Resource PointsResource points are used for purchasing, upgrading, or repairing units and for certain special abilities. In a scenario, a constant flow of resource points is provided every turn, in addition resource points can be obtained by completing certain objectives and if a scenario is completed before the turn limit is up then the resources that would have been obtained for those remaining turn are automatically obtained. In campaign mode, the resource points that remain at the end of a scenario will transfer over to the next.Command PointsCommand points determine how many more units of a given type are able to be deployed during a given turn in a scenario. Each unit type uses a certain amount of CP when it is deployed and when there are not enough CP then that unit can not be deployed until more are obtained. CP can be gained through completing certain objectives or through the destruction of a unit and auxiliary units do not use CP and thus do not give CP when destroyed. There are 3 types of CP, one for each unit type, each represented by a specific icon.Land CP: Green Helmet IconNaval CP: Blue Anchor IconAir CP: Red Aircraft IconFog of WarFog of War (FoW) represents areas of the battlefield that the player can not see, it is shown by a dark shroud over a hex. Any hex that is not within the Line of Sight (LoS) of a friendly unit is considered to be in Fog of War and any enemy unit within the FoW will not be visible. At the start of each turn, a player's units will reveal the FoW of any hex within their LoS and view distance, view distance is determined by the terrain types. When a unit is moved, it will reveal all hexes along their movement path and at the end of the turn, any hex no longer within LoS of a friendly unit will be covered by FoW.Enemy units that attack from within the FoW will automatically be revealed for the remainder of their turn. Some units, such as submarines and commandos, can be invisible to the enemy even when the hex they are in is not covered by FoW. Additionally, other units positioned in specific terrain can only be spotted when there is an adjacent ground or naval unit.Aircraft and Radar Stations are capable of seeing past their LoS range and thus able to reveal enemy ships or aircraft within the FoW. The hexes past their normal LoS are covered with a lighter shroud and enemy units detected will be identified with an icon rather than a unit model and will not show their unit type or strength.Aircraft MaintenanceAir units need fuel to continue flying and when they run low will need to be refueled at an airfield. Next to an air unit's strength will be a number showing the number of turns before the plane needs to be refueled, when this number reaches 0, the unit will begin losing strength each turn until it refuels.Refueling can be done by landing in an airfield for one turn, additional carrier-based aircraft can land on an aircraft carrier. Landing an aircraft can be done by moving the aircraft to a hex adjacent to an airfield and then clicking on the land button. On the next turn the unit can take off again by selecting the airfield, clicking on the unit, and then selecting a hex adjacent or on the airfield.Float Planes and Flying Boats do not need to be refueled which make them great for doing reconnaissance, but they have few armaments which make them an easy target for enemy aircraft.UnitsUnits CategoriesThere are three different unit categories, each category determines what hexes the unit is capable of moving on.Land Units: Can only move on land hexes.Air Units: Can move across any hex on the map when airborne.Naval Units: Can only move on water hexes.Unit ClassesUnit categories are subdivided into unit classes which determine what roles are suitable to a unit type.Infantry: Infantry are generally the bulk of a player's force. These units do well in terrain with good cover, such as cities, forests, and mountains; while in open terrain, they make easy prey to artillery and armored units. They move slowly on their own, but when equipped with a transport will have faster movement.Reconnaissance: Recon units are great for scouting out enemy positions due to their high movement values and the ability to split their total movement points into two separate moves within one turn. They can also be useful for taking out weakened enemy units, especially those that have retreated behind their lines. Land-based recon units are also more likely to retreat when attacked to give them a higher chance of survival.Tank: Tanks consist of any type of armored combat vehicle and can fight against multiple unit types. Tanks fight best when in open ground, while in heavy cover they will be vulnerable to enemy infantry. They can fight against both infantry and tanks, and even help overrun enemy defenses.Anti-Tank: AT weapons are designed for destroying tanks and can provide fire support to adjacent friendly units when those are attacked by enemy tanks. While great against tanks, they are vulnerable to enemy infantry attacks.Artillery: Artillery are useful for bombarding enemy units from a distance and lowering their efficiency. They tend to be fairly inaccurate and thus do not inflict a lot of direct damage. Towed artillery units are slow on their own, but can be provided with transports to increase their movement. Self-propelled artillery are capable of moving at a faster rate and firing in the same turn.Anti-Air: AA guns are useful for fighting off air units from the ground and thus can provide that much needed protection to a player's other ground units. Like AT weapons, AA guns can provide support fire to friendly units, but against enemy air units. Some AA guns are also capable of switching between an AA mode and an AT mode, acting as either class.Fighter: Fighters are great for taking down enemy planes and gaining air superiority, with some types designed to fight against enemy fighters, while others are designed to take down strategic bombers. Fighters can also provide fire support to a friendly bomber, land or naval unit, when they are attacked by enemy planes. Fighters can be used to attack ground and naval units, but are often ineffective in doing so, unless specifically designed for it.Tactical Bomber: Tactical bombers are capable of dealing damage to enemy ground and naval units. Some carry torpedoes which are useful against naval targets, but take time to reload; while others carry bombs which can be used against both land and naval units. Some bombers even have the ability to switch between torpedoes and bombs, but only when landed at an airfield or carrier.Strategic Bomber: Strategic bombers are similar to artillery in that they are capable of lowering an enemy unit's efficiency but do not provide a lot of direct damage. These bombers fly at much higher altitudes than tactical bombers and thus make them difficult to take down, often requiring specialized fighters or AA guns to do so. Strategic bombers can also bomb enemy supply sources, lowering the supply output.Destroyer: Destroyers are cheap and fast, and thus often taken in large numbers. This makes them ideal for scouting and screening a fleet's larger ships. Destroyers also carry torpedoes which can deliver deadly blows to large enemy warships, sonar which can be used to spot submerged enemy submarines, and depth charges to destroy submarines.Cruiser: Cruisers are fast, medium-sized warships which are good for escorting important targets. Cruisers also have AA guns to fend off enemy air attacks. They are slightly slower than destroyers but can deal out more damage to enemy ships.Battleship: Battleships are the largest and most powerful ships in the game, but are also the most expensive as a result. They can attack enemy ground and naval units from a large distance and against ground units will act like artillery, causing efficiency loss instead of direct damage. Battleships are completely incapable of fighting enemy submarines, thus requiring destroyers to protect them from such threats.Carrier: Carriers are mobile airfields on the water and can maintain carrier-based aircraft. Carriers are great for supporting naval encounters and beach landing when there are no land-based airfields nearby. Carriers come in different sizes and can store anywhere from one to three air units depending on its size.Submarine: Submarines are naval units which can move and attack while submerged, thus making them hard to spot. While submerged, only enemy ships with sonar will be able to reveal and attack a submarine.Structures: Structures are incapable of moving and consist of units that can attack and have strong defenses or passive units that serve various functions.Transports: Transports are units that are attached to other units such as infantry or towed weapons to increase their movement. Transports can be land, air, naval, or even railroad based.Mines: Mines are immovable units that once deployed, belong to neither side. Mines can only be spotted by an adjacent unit of the same type as the mine and once spotted will remain visible. Mines can only be removed by moving a unit through them, which will deal damage to that unit; or by using the Mine Clearing ability of a unit that has it.Unit StatsEach unit has a set of stats that determine how effective a unit is at a number of things.Strength: Strength is essentially a unit's health, it represents how many men are in a unit. During combat strength is reduced, and it can be replenished using the Repair abilities. The higher the strength, the more damage a unit is capable of doing in combat; and when it is reduced to 0, the unit is destroyed.Entrenchment: Entrenchment represents how well a unit has prepared defenses in a given location. If a unit remains stationary and does not attack it will prepare defenses on its current position making the unit more resistant to attack.Experience: Experience represents how much a unit has learned from its time in the field. It will increase over time as a unit fights, and more experienced units are better in combat and thus more difficult to destroy.Chassis: Chassis tells how a unit moves, whether that be by foot, tracks, or wheels for land units; or for naval units, shallow draft, deep draft, and submerged. Chassis type determines how well a unit can move through different terrain types or water depths.Movement Points: Movement points represent how quickly a unit can move. These are used up as a unit moves, depending on their chassis and the terrain they move through.Line of Sight (LoS): Represents the view range of a unit, each terrain type has a LoS cost which determine how far away in a given direction each unit will be able to see.Range: How far a unit can shoot. A unit with a range of 0 needs to be adjacent to the enemy unit and be able to enter that terrain type in order to attack.Attack: Each unit type has a series of attack values for each unit category that are used when it attacks this category.Defense: Each unit type has a series of defense values for each unit category that are used when it is attacked by this category.Offensive Combat Type (OCT): The defense stat that is used by the enemy when this unit attacks.Defensive Combat Type (OCT): The attack stat that is used by the enemy when it attack this unit.Bombardment: Represents how much damage can be done when a strategic bomber attacks a supply source.Shock: Represents how much efficiency an enemy unit will lose when it is bombarded by this unit.Assault: Represents how much damage a unit will do to enemy entrenchment at the beginning of their attack.Downloadable ContentBattle of Britain ModThe Battle of Britain Mod was released as a free update for Order of Battle: World War II on September 15, 2015 to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain.The Battle of Britain mod feature two scenarios, Unit Demonstration and the Battle of Britain.Unit DemonstrationThis scenario introduces the player to the new units that have been added as part of the Battle of Britain Mod.Battle of BritainThis scenario is the main scenario of the mod, featuring the historical Battle of Britain, the map includes southern England and the northern French, Belgian and Dutch coasts. Players command the Royal Air Force and are given the objective to keep the British morale up while simultaneously diminishing the German morale.British morale is kept up by protecting the British supply ships which make their way through the English Channel and through the Thames River to London, and by protecting British cities from German air raids. German morale can be lowered by destroying German bombers and disrupting their plans for Operation Sea Lion.Secondary objectives include protecting the radar stations along the southern coast of England, destroying German Stuka bombers, and taking out a coastal gun battery.Morning SunMorning Sun is the first expansion pack for Order of Battle: World War II which takes place during the Second Sino-Japanese War and allows players to command the Japanese as they invade China in 11 new scenarios. It also includes new features such as the ability for players to construct small airstrips where they choose, horse transportation and cavalry units, new terrain types, and many new units.U.S. MarinesU.S. Marines is the second expansion pack for Order of Battle: World War II. The expansion allows players to control the U.S. Marines in the island hopping campaign in the Pacific Theatre of World War II, between 1942-1945. It includes the following scenarios: Tulagi, Guadalcanal, Munda Point, Blissful & Goodtime, Bougainville, Gilbert Islands, Marshall Islands, Saipan, Guam, Palau, and Iwo Jima; as well as some new units.Winter WarWinter War is the third expansion pack which includes the Winter War (1939-1940), the Continuation War (1941-1944), and the Lapland War (1944-1945). Players get to take control of the Finnish Army with supporting troops from either Germany or the Soviet Union depending on the outcomes. The expansion also includes over 90 new units, and a new climate: winter, making movement across the terrain slow and difficult.Rising SunRising Sun is one of two campaigns that were originally included in Order of Battle: Pacific and later released as an expansion pack when the game was renamed and became free. In Rising Sun, players command the forces of Imperial Japan starting at Pearl Harbor and continue on through both historic and theoretical scenarios in an attempt to change history and win the war as Japan.U.S. PacificU.S. Pacific is one of two campaigns that were originally included in Order of Battle: Pacific and later released as an expansion pack when the game was renamed and became free. In U.S. Pacific, players command the Allied forces led by the US starting at Pearl Harbor and continuing through the historical battles, ending with the Invasion of Japan.System RequirementsPCMinimumOS: Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8Processor: Pentium 4 or equivalentMemory: 2 GB RAMGraphics: 512 MB DirectX 9 video card with shader model 2.0DirectX: Version 9.0cHard Drive: 1 GB available spaceSound Card: DirectX compatible sound cardMacMinimumOS: Mac OS X 10.7+Graphics: DirectX 9 video card with shader model 2.0Hard Drive: 1 GB available space",,,,,,,,,

It was originally released as a Steam Early Access game on October 23, 2013 (with numerous updates since then) and will be released for the Xbox One on April 15, 2020.GameplayA view from the cockpit of a small shipThe alpha version of the game is currently limited to an open-ended creative mode and allows the player to construct 3 object types; small ships, large ships and space stations. The initial environments are limited in scope to a few nearby asteroids.Small ships can be piloted from a cockpit or chase view, while large ships are limited to an external camera.While its certainly apt to compare the title to something like Minecraft in space, a better comparison of the actual ship construction mechanic might be something like the creative mode in Banjoo-Kazooie Nuts and Bolts. In an interview with a local gaming channel, IndianTV, one of the developers said part of the inspiration for the game was Lego.As the game development continues new mechanics like mining asteroids, ship-to-ship and on-foot combat and crafting (assembling) objects will begin to be enabled. Survival Modestages of constructing an object in survival modeIn March of 2014 Space Engineers introduced a survival mode game play type. Presented to the players as the most significant update to the game, this game mode requires players to gather and refine resources and construct ships and bases using a welding tool.Items will appear in various levels of completion as the construction commences.In order to increase the sense of conflict and danger in this mode, meteor showers can appear, damage structures and kill the player. MultiplayerReleased in early 2014, Multiplayer was one of the features that was initially confirmed and the game's small development team has indicated that it will be one of the games major features. Currently Multiplayer is available in the game and will be continued to be improved over time.

It was released March 31st, 2022, for PC, Xbox One, PS4, and Nintendo Switch.StoryThe story follows the game's protagonist, Princess Farmer, who one day goes from being an ordinary farmer to waking up under the Gaia Tree and meeting Mother Gaia, transforming her into Princess Farmer. As Princess Farmer, she uses her new magic powers to help Mother Gaia pull vegetables from gardens for the citizens and creatures of the world, while also fighting off a mysterious enemy that is transforming people into monsters with strange gummi vegetables.GameplayThe match-3 game board is represented as garden with vegetables buried underground. In order to make matches, the player moves over a column of vegetables and is able to pull up the vegetable that is immediately underneath. The vegetable can then be placed in another column in order to make matches. A total of five vegetables can be pulled up and held at a time.The game's story mode is broken up into nine chapters. Each chapter has an overworld map that is broken up into stages containing a different match-3 board, or an NPC that can be talked to, which often contains dialogue choices for the player to choose from. Match-3 boards are completed by satisfying different conditions on each puzzle, such as making matches of a specific type of vegetable or scoring a certain number of points within a time limit. Some stages also contain a battle mode that involves fighting an enemy in a race to make matches. A form of currency is rewarded based on how well the player did, which can then be used to purchase new cosmetic items.The game can be played in either single player or co-op mode and contains three different play styles to choose from:""Action Bunny"" - A fast paced style that is focused on making a lot of combos quickly""Puzzle Bunny"" - A slower paced style that focuses on just making matches""Balanced Bunny"" - A combination of both modesSoundtrackThe game's soundtrack is composed by Astra Tanuki and was made available to purchase digitally.TrackTitleLength1.PF Theme (2020 trailer music)01:222.the PF VHS collection01:013.Community Barden Groove02:354.bunny dream~02:205.Gaia Valley Morning01:406.goodnight pf <301:147.Chill Forest Afternoon02:128....very mysterious02:299.COWS?!?!?04:2410.Bunbot Beat~02:3511.Carrot Tops03:4012.Tulip's Garden02:4313.Tulip's Garden (cutecore breakbeat remix)02:2614.Rooftop Gardens GONE WILD01:3615.~Magic Forest Beat~03:0316.this isn't chill at all02:3817.Tall, Dark, and Shadowy02:2218.Pancakes!04:1519.shoe gays01:1520.Moonroof03:21",,,,,,,,,

As a traditional side-scrolling shooter in the same vein as Gradius or Scramble, A Shooter does not have much in terms of plot or gameplay depth, and is exactly what it is described as in the title. The game received mediocre reception, as most criticized the game for being too simplistic or too easy. Upon its release, Sorcery Games held a contest for those who could score the highest in the game. Players who topped the online leaderboards won a T-shirt depicting the Sorcery Games logo. Five different players won a T-shirt, with only one player actually completing A Shooter's thirteen levels. The first winner, SinedX360, was the first person to get a score on the leaderboards, differing from the other winners of the contest. Gameplay Â One item transforms enemy fire into score boosting fruit The gameplay of A Shooter is fairly simplistic, even compared to other games in the side-scrolling shooter genre. The player is on the left side of the screen, and enemies approach from the sides as the player attempts to reach the boss, progressing to the right. At the end of each of A Shooter's thirteen levels is a boss, who must be defeated in order to move on to the next stage. A Shooter also allows players to reload any level that has been reached (even if it has not been completed). As a traditional shooter, the game naturally contains a variety of power-ups and items. The power-ups mostly consist of additional lasers in other directions, aiding in destroying the more difficult enemies appearing from all sides in later levels. Bombs function differently than normal. Instead of destroying all enemies on the screen, bombs destroy lasers surrounding the player's ship. Another variety of the bomb transforms all enemy lasers into score boosting fruit. Â The game also contains an offline multiplayer component A Shooter also contains an offline multiplayer component, for up to four players. Each player appears as a differently colored and shaped ship. Player power-ups are not shared, requiring each player to collect their own items and weapon upgrades. A Shooter also has online leaderboards, as well as the offline multiplayer mode. However, unlike Xbox Live Arcade and retail Xbox 360 games, A Shooter's leaderboards only function correctly when in direct communication with a host Xbox 360, requiring multiple players to be online when a score is made (this is typically circumvented by the developer keeping a constant host Xbox 360 online and playing the game).",,,,,,,,,

1473430,Street Fighter V - Season 5 Premium Pass,3999,Capcom,Capcom,0,0,0,Action,"English, French, Italian, German, Spanish - Spain, Arabic, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese - Brazil, Russian, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese",,,"OverviewStreet Fighter V is a 2.5D fighting game developed by Capcom (in conjunction with Dimps) and published by Capcom for the PlayStation 4 and PC on February 16, 2016.The fifth numbered installment of the Street Fighter fighting game series, Street Fighter V builds on its predecessor with a new graphical engine (running on Unreal Engine 4), revamped gameplay mechanics (including a new ""V-Gauge"" meter, which replaces the ""Revenge Gauge"" of the previous game and grants special character-specific abilities). It is also the first game in the series to feature cross-platform multiplayer.Rather than having multiple separate revisions of the game (as with every main installment of the series other than the first), Street Fighter V focuses on having a single installment with regular system and balance updates provided for free. Additional post-release content, including fighters, stages, and costumes, must be purchased either as paid DLC or with an in-game currency known as ""Fight Money"". Later monetization options include seasonal DLC passes and optional in-game advertisements (which give players additional FM).Street Fighter V takes place between the events of Street Fighter IV and Street Fighter III, and features much of the cast of previous Street Fighter games (with four new challengers at launch). The main in-game story, called ""A Shadow Falls"", was released as free DLC on July 1, 2016, and chronicles a Shadaloo plan to launch seven satellites (known as the ""Black Moons"") to aid M. Bison in his plans for world domination.The game later received a major revision on January 16, 2018. Dubbed the ""Arcade Edition"", this version adds new gameplay mechanics, new online and offline modes, and a revamped UI. It also received a minor revision on February 14, 2020 as the ""Champion Edition"", making several gameplay and balance changes. While all of these changes were included for free, the game itself received a re-release (both downloadable and retail) for each revision, including most DLC content released up to that time.The game also received an arcade port (as Street Fighter V: Type Arcade) in Japan on March 14, 2019. Running on the PC-based Taito Type X4 hardware and utilizing Taito's NESiCAxLive2 digital distribution service, this version includes online multiplayer support, an updated eight-button control panel (with both ""EX"" buttons customizable), external USB gamepad support, support for both NESiCA and Amusement IC cards, and an option to link IC cards with CFN accounts to use unlocked alternate costumes from the home version.A Linux version of the game was announced at launch, but was never released.GameplayNash performing his Critical Art against Ryu Much of the gameplay in Street Fighter V remains the same as previous installments, featuring a one-on-one fight on a 2D plane/line with a six-button control scheme (three punches of different strengths and three kicks of different strengths).Returning from Street Fighter IV is the Super Combo Gauge (now known as the three-stock Critical Gauge), which are used for powerful Super Combos (now known as Critical Arts, which utilizes the whole Gauge) and EX Moves (powered-up versions of Special Moves that use one stock of the Gauge and are performed by pressing an additional corresponding Punch/Kick button). Also returning are forwards/backwards dashing, two-button Normal Throws (where throws are performed by pressing both Light buttons), Throw Escapes (where performing a Normal Throw at the right time negates an opponent's Normal Throw), and Counter Hits (where hitting an opponent during their attack's start-up gives extra damage and faster recovery). Additionally, the Guard Meter (now known as the Stun Gauge) returns from Street Fighter Alpha 3, which indicates when the fighter becomes dizzied.The Revenge Gauge, Ultra Combo, and Focus Attack systems from Street Fighter IV were replaced with the new V-Gauge system. In addition, the game includes many basic core system tweaks:Proximity Attacks have been removed, with fighters performing the same standing normal attack with the same input regardless of how close they are to their opponent. Certain proximity attacks were brought back per-character as Unique Attacks (which usually have a joystick input in addition to the attack button).Directional Air Attacks have been removed, with fighters performing the same jumping normal attack regardless if they are jumping straight up or jumping forwards/backwards.Both Medium and Heavy normal attacks now cause recoverable chip damage (or ""white damage"") when blocked. Similar to the damage absorbed from Focus Attacks in Street Fighter IV, ""white damage"" cannot be used to K.O. and can be recovered over time if the fighter does not receive actual damage. Some other attacks, such as V-Reversals, also deal ""white damage"".Link Combos, where players can combo normal attacks based on the previous attack's recovery animation (rather than animation-cancelling), now have a lenient buffer window to perform, with difficult ""1-frame links"" (where players only have 1/60th of a second of opportunity to perform) now becoming ""3-frame links"" (where players now have 1/20th of a second).Special Moves and EX Moves no longer K.O. on chip damage. The only ability that can are Critical Arts.The Quick Stand mechanic from Street Fighter IV is retooled as Recovery, in which players can quickly rise from being knocked down after certain attacks to negate mix-ups. This can be performed as Neutral Recovery by either pressing downwards on the joystick or pressing two Punch buttons simultaneously, or with the new Back Recovery option (which causes a backwards slide) by either pressing backwards on the joystick or pressing two Kick buttons simultaneously. Unlike the previous game, players can now perform Recovery after being thrown or from a standard sweep (unless it was hit as a Crush Counter).New to the series are Crush Counters, in which some Heavy normal attacks and Unique Attacks cause a staggering, launching, knockdown, or knockback effect when landed as a Counter Hit. Which attacks does this and their effects depends on the character, although all characters have a special knockdown effect on their traditional sweeping attack (which is one of the few attacks that disables the Recovery option). In addition, landing this attack fills up a portion of the V-Gauge. To balance this added potency, attacks with the Crush Counter ability are unsafe on block in many situations.V-GaugeNecalli's V-Skill, ""Culminated Power"", that allows him to sweep his opponent from a distance The Revenge Gauge system from Street Fighter IV is replaced with the V-Gauge, a core mechanic of the game that is used to perform two new abilities: V-Reversal and V-Trigger. Season Five added a third ability that also uses this meter, called V-Shift.Similar to the Revenge Gauge itself, the V-Gauge is a separate meter that fills up as the fighter blocks and receives damage. It is also filled up by performing unique V-Skill abilities (which replaces Focus Attacks from the previous game) and landing Crush Counters. The meter itself has multiple stocks, which varies (1-3) depending on the chosen V-Trigger, and resets between rounds.V-Skill - Performed by pressing both Medium attack buttons (MP+MK), the V-Skill is a character-specific free-to-use action that ranges from unique attacks to parries and projectile-counters. Successfully using it also generates a portion of the V-Gauge. Since Season Four, players can choose an alternate V-Skill for each character during character selection.V-Reversal - Performed while in blockstun by tapping forward on the joystick and pressing either all three Punch or Kick buttons according to character (f+3P or f+3K), the V-Reversal is a character-specific guard-cancelling action that ranges from counter-attacks (that knockdown or knockback opponents and deal ""white damage"") to evasive movement. It costs a single stock of V-Gauge to perform and instantly recovers a portion of the character's Stun Gauge.V-Shift - Performed by pressing Heavy Punch and Medium Kick together (HP+MK), the V-Shift is a special universal evasive action that allows the fighter to perform a backwards dash with temporary invincibility. While it costs a single stock of V-Gauge to perform normally, one-half of that stock is recovered if the V-Shift is timed to evade an attack (which also increases its invincibility frames). During a V-Shift, players can input the command again to continue into a lunging knockdown counter-attack known as the V-Shift Break. Added in Season Five.V-Trigger - Performed by pressing both Heavy attack buttons (HP+HK), the V-Trigger is a character-specific limited-use action seen as a more-powerful version of the V-Skill. It consists of either a unique attack or maneuver, or a limited-time power-up (which enhances certain attacks or allows use of new special moves). It costs a full V-Gauge to perform, and can be activated by animation-cancelling various normal and special attacks. Since Season Three, players can choose an alternate V-Trigger for each character during character selection.Play ModesSingle-Player ModesOpening tutorialArcade Mode - Players can relieve past story lines from the Street Fighter franchise by taking on a ladder of characters custom themed for numerous past titles, earning character-specific endings and artwork in the process.Story Mode - Players pick their challenger and fight through a set of AI battles, punctuated by cutscenes that offer insights into each character's personality and motivations.Survival Mode - Players face a series of opponents on a single healthbar, earning points along the way that can be used to purchase various powerups.Challenge Mode - Challenge Mode consists of four separate modes:Demonstrations - A series of tutorials designed to help players of all levels understand and improve the way they play SFV, as well as provide advice on how to use each of the 16 characters.Trials - Combo challenges for each character ranging from basic to advanced.Missions - Goals that renew weekly, allowing players can complete to earn Fight Money and special unlocks.Extra Battle - Fights against special CPU bosses with in-game rewards for completion.Cinematic Story Mode - Bridging the narrative gap between Street Fighter IV and Street Fighter III, players take control of a wide variety of characters as they play through the story of SFV, told through a series of fully-animated cutscenes.Multiplayer ModesRanked match results screenSFV features cross-platform online multiplayer between PC and PS4 using an all-new proprietary netcode. Nicknamed ""Kagemusha"", this netcode utilizes rollback technology akin to the popular GGPO fighting game netcode.Offline Versus Mode - Player can battle each other over 1, 3 or 5 rounds that can last either 60 or 99 seconds.Battle Lounge - Up to 8 players can enter an online lobby together and play for as long as they'd like in a winner-stays-on format.Ranked Match - Players can enter matches against random online opponents to compete for LP and increase their rank on the SFV leaderboards. After a game, players have the option to agree to continue the set, up to a best-of-3.Casual Match - Players can be matched up against random opponents and test their skills without the risk of having their LP be impacted. Similar to Ranked, players have the option to play in an extended set.Intentional Disconnects - In an effort to combat players intentionally disconnecting from the game to avoid a loss (or ""rage quitters""), Capcom has implemented a system that will punish a player after 3 intentional disconnects within 2 hours, locking them out of matchmaking for 24 hours and docking them 1000LP.CharactersThe game's original release included 16 playable characters, four of which are new additions to the series.

1473431,Street Fighter V - Season 5 Character Pass,2499,Capcom,Capcom,0,0,0,Action,"English, French, Italian, German, Spanish - Spain, Arabic, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese - Brazil, Russian, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese",,,"OverviewStreet Fighter V is a 2.5D fighting game developed by Capcom (in conjunction with Dimps) and published by Capcom for the PlayStation 4 and PC on February 16, 2016.The fifth numbered installment of the Street Fighter fighting game series, Street Fighter V builds on its predecessor with a new graphical engine (running on Unreal Engine 4), revamped gameplay mechanics (including a new ""V-Gauge"" meter, which replaces the ""Revenge Gauge"" of the previous game and grants special character-specific abilities). It is also the first game in the series to feature cross-platform multiplayer.Rather than having multiple separate revisions of the game (as with every main installment of the series other than the first), Street Fighter V focuses on having a single installment with regular system and balance updates provided for free. Additional post-release content, including fighters, stages, and costumes, must be purchased either as paid DLC or with an in-game currency known as ""Fight Money"". Later monetization options include seasonal DLC passes and optional in-game advertisements (which give players additional FM).Street Fighter V takes place between the events of Street Fighter IV and Street Fighter III, and features much of the cast of previous Street Fighter games (with four new challengers at launch). The main in-game story, called ""A Shadow Falls"", was released as free DLC on July 1, 2016, and chronicles a Shadaloo plan to launch seven satellites (known as the ""Black Moons"") to aid M. Bison in his plans for world domination.The game later received a major revision on January 16, 2018. Dubbed the ""Arcade Edition"", this version adds new gameplay mechanics, new online and offline modes, and a revamped UI. It also received a minor revision on February 14, 2020 as the ""Champion Edition"", making several gameplay and balance changes. While all of these changes were included for free, the game itself received a re-release (both downloadable and retail) for each revision, including most DLC content released up to that time.The game also received an arcade port (as Street Fighter V: Type Arcade) in Japan on March 14, 2019. Running on the PC-based Taito Type X4 hardware and utilizing Taito's NESiCAxLive2 digital distribution service, this version includes online multiplayer support, an updated eight-button control panel (with both ""EX"" buttons customizable), external USB gamepad support, support for both NESiCA and Amusement IC cards, and an option to link IC cards with CFN accounts to use unlocked alternate costumes from the home version.A Linux version of the game was announced at launch, but was never released.GameplayNash performing his Critical Art against Ryu Much of the gameplay in Street Fighter V remains the same as previous installments, featuring a one-on-one fight on a 2D plane/line with a six-button control scheme (three punches of different strengths and three kicks of different strengths).Returning from Street Fighter IV is the Super Combo Gauge (now known as the three-stock Critical Gauge), which are used for powerful Super Combos (now known as Critical Arts, which utilizes the whole Gauge) and EX Moves (powered-up versions of Special Moves that use one stock of the Gauge and are performed by pressing an additional corresponding Punch/Kick button). Also returning are forwards/backwards dashing, two-button Normal Throws (where throws are performed by pressing both Light buttons), Throw Escapes (where performing a Normal Throw at the right time negates an opponent's Normal Throw), and Counter Hits (where hitting an opponent during their attack's start-up gives extra damage and faster recovery). Additionally, the Guard Meter (now known as the Stun Gauge) returns from Street Fighter Alpha 3, which indicates when the fighter becomes dizzied.The Revenge Gauge, Ultra Combo, and Focus Attack systems from Street Fighter IV were replaced with the new V-Gauge system. In addition, the game includes many basic core system tweaks:Proximity Attacks have been removed, with fighters performing the same standing normal attack with the same input regardless of how close they are to their opponent. Certain proximity attacks were brought back per-character as Unique Attacks (which usually have a joystick input in addition to the attack button).Directional Air Attacks have been removed, with fighters performing the same jumping normal attack regardless if they are jumping straight up or jumping forwards/backwards.Both Medium and Heavy normal attacks now cause recoverable chip damage (or ""white damage"") when blocked. Similar to the damage absorbed from Focus Attacks in Street Fighter IV, ""white damage"" cannot be used to K.O. and can be recovered over time if the fighter does not receive actual damage. Some other attacks, such as V-Reversals, also deal ""white damage"".Link Combos, where players can combo normal attacks based on the previous attack's recovery animation (rather than animation-cancelling), now have a lenient buffer window to perform, with difficult ""1-frame links"" (where players only have 1/60th of a second of opportunity to perform) now becoming ""3-frame links"" (where players now have 1/20th of a second).Special Moves and EX Moves no longer K.O. on chip damage. The only ability that can are Critical Arts.The Quick Stand mechanic from Street Fighter IV is retooled as Recovery, in which players can quickly rise from being knocked down after certain attacks to negate mix-ups. This can be performed as Neutral Recovery by either pressing downwards on the joystick or pressing two Punch buttons simultaneously, or with the new Back Recovery option (which causes a backwards slide) by either pressing backwards on the joystick or pressing two Kick buttons simultaneously. Unlike the previous game, players can now perform Recovery after being thrown or from a standard sweep (unless it was hit as a Crush Counter).New to the series are Crush Counters, in which some Heavy normal attacks and Unique Attacks cause a staggering, launching, knockdown, or knockback effect when landed as a Counter Hit. Which attacks does this and their effects depends on the character, although all characters have a special knockdown effect on their traditional sweeping attack (which is one of the few attacks that disables the Recovery option). In addition, landing this attack fills up a portion of the V-Gauge. To balance this added potency, attacks with the Crush Counter ability are unsafe on block in many situations.V-GaugeNecalli's V-Skill, ""Culminated Power"", that allows him to sweep his opponent from a distance The Revenge Gauge system from Street Fighter IV is replaced with the V-Gauge, a core mechanic of the game that is used to perform two new abilities: V-Reversal and V-Trigger. Season Five added a third ability that also uses this meter, called V-Shift.Similar to the Revenge Gauge itself, the V-Gauge is a separate meter that fills up as the fighter blocks and receives damage. It is also filled up by performing unique V-Skill abilities (which replaces Focus Attacks from the previous game) and landing Crush Counters. The meter itself has multiple stocks, which varies (1-3) depending on the chosen V-Trigger, and resets between rounds.V-Skill - Performed by pressing both Medium attack buttons (MP+MK), the V-Skill is a character-specific free-to-use action that ranges from unique attacks to parries and projectile-counters. Successfully using it also generates a portion of the V-Gauge. Since Season Four, players can choose an alternate V-Skill for each character during character selection.V-Reversal - Performed while in blockstun by tapping forward on the joystick and pressing either all three Punch or Kick buttons according to character (f+3P or f+3K), the V-Reversal is a character-specific guard-cancelling action that ranges from counter-attacks (that knockdown or knockback opponents and deal ""white damage"") to evasive movement. It costs a single stock of V-Gauge to perform and instantly recovers a portion of the character's Stun Gauge.V-Shift - Performed by pressing Heavy Punch and Medium Kick together (HP+MK), the V-Shift is a special universal evasive action that allows the fighter to perform a backwards dash with temporary invincibility. While it costs a single stock of V-Gauge to perform normally, one-half of that stock is recovered if the V-Shift is timed to evade an attack (which also increases its invincibility frames). During a V-Shift, players can input the command again to continue into a lunging knockdown counter-attack known as the V-Shift Break. Added in Season Five.V-Trigger - Performed by pressing both Heavy attack buttons (HP+HK), the V-Trigger is a character-specific limited-use action seen as a more-powerful version of the V-Skill. It consists of either a unique attack or maneuver, or a limited-time power-up (which enhances certain attacks or allows use of new special moves). It costs a full V-Gauge to perform, and can be activated by animation-cancelling various normal and special attacks. Since Season Three, players can choose an alternate V-Trigger for each character during character selection.Play ModesSingle-Player ModesOpening tutorialArcade Mode - Players can relieve past story lines from the Street Fighter franchise by taking on a ladder of characters custom themed for numerous past titles, earning character-specific endings and artwork in the process.Story Mode - Players pick their challenger and fight through a set of AI battles, punctuated by cutscenes that offer insights into each character's personality and motivations.Survival Mode - Players face a series of opponents on a single healthbar, earning points along the way that can be used to purchase various powerups.Challenge Mode - Challenge Mode consists of four separate modes:Demonstrations - A series of tutorials designed to help players of all levels understand and improve the way they play SFV, as well as provide advice on how to use each of the 16 characters.Trials - Combo challenges for each character ranging from basic to advanced.Missions - Goals that renew weekly, allowing players can complete to earn Fight Money and special unlocks.Extra Battle - Fights against special CPU bosses with in-game rewards for completion.Cinematic Story Mode - Bridging the narrative gap between Street Fighter IV and Street Fighter III, players take control of a wide variety of characters as they play through the story of SFV, told through a series of fully-animated cutscenes.Multiplayer ModesRanked match results screenSFV features cross-platform online multiplayer between PC and PS4 using an all-new proprietary netcode.

Each character received a secondary V-Trigger to be selected before battle, and beyond the individual balance tweaks a few cast-wide changes were made:Decreased damage on V-Trigger cancel combosIncreased recovery on command grabsIncreased reliance on specific normals to anti-airEarly April, 2018, shortly after the start of the Capcom Pro Tour for that year, a large balance update was released. In addition to various balance changes across the cast, a number of broader changes were made to the game as a whole:Decreased damage on Crush Counter combosFurther decreased anti-air capability of light attacksIncreased throw strengths relative to a character's ability to pressure the opponent following a successful throwTimed with the grand finals of the 2018 Capcom Pro Tour, the season 4 balance update was released in December alongside new character Kage. Most characters received extensive adjustments, some new moves, and a few smaller tweaks were made on a baseline mechanical level:Attacks absorbed by armor that reduce the white-life gauge to zero will KO the opponentCharacters take 1.2x the normal damage from the first attack they receive during the recovery of a frame 1 reversalAll characters can now be hit out of their V-Trigger activation animation, as opposed to someDuring the leadup to Evolution 2019, a character trailer was released detailing the Season 4 Character Pass which would include E.

Every time our characters touch each others the game pauses for a moment and we have to kiss in real life.The game itself is eternal like the damnation, but at some point the play is meant to transition into foreplay.uuDeveloper: TR-404A 2 player competitive game using only two keys on the keyboard (P and Q, one for each player).

1472570,World War Battle Simulator,,,,0,0,0,,,,,"OverviewOrder of Battle: World War II is a turn-based strategy game developed by The Aristocrats and published by Slitherine Games. Order of Battle: World War II features turn-based, hex-based tactical gameplay set in World War II. It has a 3D game map with detailed animations and effects, over 700 different units, unique commanders that can be attached to the player's units, and 20 different specializations to give a unique feel to the player's army. Order of Battle: World War II also includes multiplayer with up to 4 players using its PBEM++ system and an in-game scenario editor.The game was originally released as Order of Battle: Pacific on April 30, 2015 and included what are now the Rising Sun and U.S. Pacific DLCs. On June 14, 2016, the game was renamed to Order of Battle: World War II and became free to play, with the two original campaigns becoming DLC.Order of Battle: World War II includes the Boot Camp tutorial campaign and allows players to play the first scenario of any DLC campaign. In order for players to unlock the scenario editor and multiplayer with all of the factions, only a single DLC needs to be purchased.GameplaySingle-player modesCampaignPlayers can choose play the Boot Camp campaign and the first scenario of any other campaign for free. Each campaign has a series of linked scenarios that allow a player's core forces to carry over from one to the next. Players can also choose between 5 difficulty levels as listed below under scenario difficulty.Boot Camp: The tutorial, this campaign teaches the player the basics of the game. Players control a group of US recruits in a series of training exercises against another team of US recruits.ScenarioPlayers can play individual scenarios with no core force carryover. A number of additional options are provided for scenario play.Quick Experience: Units gain experience faster than normal, allowing players to obtain elite units within a single scenario.Combat Randomizing: Combat outcome is slightly randomized, thus does not always match the estimated results provided prior to an attack.Custom Starting Force: Allows players to purchase and deploy their own core force instead of using the default force provided by the scenario.Scenario Difficulty: There are five difficulties, I to V, with V being the hardest. Difficulty determines the max unit strength for AI units. These are identical to the ones in campaign play.I: AI max unit strength is 6II: AI max unit strength is 8III: AI max unit strength is 10 (Normal difficulty)IV: AI max unit strength is 12V: AI max unit strength is 13Multiplayer modesHotseatIn hotseat multiplayer, up to 4 players can play in a game on the same device. Players must hand over the controls to the next player when their turn is over.Online PBEM++PBEM++ allows players to play against other players from anywhere in the world over the internet. It requires players to log in to a server in order to play. Play is asynchronous, meaning that both players do not need to be online at the same time; one player can log in, take their turn, and then upload the results to the master server; the server can then notify the other player that it is their turn and that player can take their turn when they are ready.Campaign PlayCampaign mode consists of decisions made on the campaign map, the management of a Core Force, choice of specializations, and scenario play.Campaign MapThe campaign map will display where the campaign is taking place, what territory is controlled by whom, and the next available mission(s) which are represented by pushpins. The campaign map will also allow the player to choose the difficulty level, review any specializations the player may have, and view the player's Core Force.Core ForceUnits purchased during a campaign will be part of the player's Core Force and will be identified on the map by the gold outline of their strength plates. The Core Force will travel with the player throughout the campaign and with the experience they gain throughout the battles, will be the key to victory.Auxiliary units: These are the units that are automatically deployed at the start of a scenario during campaign play and are not part of the player's Core Force. As such these units will not carry over with the player from mission to mission. They are identified by a black outline around the strength plateSpecializationsAt certain points throughout a campaign, a player will be presented with a choice between two specializations. A player may only choose one of the two and will be forced to keep that selection for the remainder of the campaign. Specializations give a player's forces unique abilities and units.Scenario PlayScenario play involves fighting battles and capturing objectives.Briefing and ObjectivesAt the start of most scenarios there will be a briefing sequence which will take the player through the objectives and give the plater a background of the mission. Scenarios will contain two types of objectives, primary and secondary.Primary Objectives: These objectives are mandatory in order to win the scenario.Secondary Objectives: These objectives are optional to complete and doing so will provide bonuses in the current scenario or future scenarios in a campaign.All scenarios will have a turn limit, all primary objectives need to be complete before that limit is over, otherwise the scenario will end in a defeat. Players should also keep in mind that it will not always be possible to complete all secondary objectives within a scenario.Victory & Capture PointsSome hexes will contain flags which mark them as a victory or capture point. There are two types of victory points, primary and secondary, and they are linked to the primary and secondary obectives. Capture points simply represent important locations which can be captured for additional supply and deployment zones, in addition to victory points. When capturing a point, it will take 3 turns before the player will receive supply or before they can deploy from that point. Victory and capture points are represented by the star above the flag.Primary VPs: Marked with a gold star.Secondary VPs: Marked with a silver star.Capture Points (CP): Marked with a bronze star.Hexes & TerritoryAll hexes on the map are controlled by one of the players and can be captured by moving a land or naval unit through them. Air units are unable to capture hexes. The borders of a player's territory are shown by thick red lines which follow the hex edges along the boundary between opposing territories. Hexes with victory or capture points will show the flag of the faction that controls it and isolated hexes of one side containing no units or supply sources will be automatically captured by the enemy if they are completely surrounded.Supply SystemBoth land and air units require a certain amount of supply in order to remain at full efficiency. Without enough supply, units will lose efficiency until their efficiency level matches their supply level. Efficiency level affects how well a unit can defend and attack, their movement, and how quickly they can repair or reinforce.Naval units (excluding carriers) can provide supply by being adjacent to a land hex. Land units draw supply from any land-based supply source or from naval units that are adjacent to a land hex, provided that a player controls the hexes between the unit and the supply sources. Air units draw supply from any airfield on the map, and carrier-based aircraft can also draw supply from aircraft carriers.TerrainAll hexes have a terrain type, and every terrain type has a set of stats that determine its effects on combat. Players can check the stats of a hex by using the terrain information panel.Attacker Combat Factor: Determines the amount of casualties an attacker will inflict on the defender. A higher value means the attacker will inflict more casualties, and a lower value means an attacker will inflict less.Defender Combat Factor: Determines the amount of casualties a defender will inflict on the attacker. Higher is better for the defender, lower is worse for the defender.Cover Rating: The amount of cover that is available from direct fire.Disruption Penalty: The efficiency loss for moving through this terrain.Disembark Penalty: The efficiency loss for disembarking on this terrain.Resource PointsResource points are used for purchasing, upgrading, or repairing units and for certain special abilities. In a scenario, a constant flow of resource points is provided every turn, in addition resource points can be obtained by completing certain objectives and if a scenario is completed before the turn limit is up then the resources that would have been obtained for those remaining turn are automatically obtained. In campaign mode, the resource points that remain at the end of a scenario will transfer over to the next.Command PointsCommand points determine how many more units of a given type are able to be deployed during a given turn in a scenario. Each unit type uses a certain amount of CP when it is deployed and when there are not enough CP then that unit can not be deployed until more are obtained. CP can be gained through completing certain objectives or through the destruction of a unit and auxiliary units do not use CP and thus do not give CP when destroyed. There are 3 types of CP, one for each unit type, each represented by a specific icon.Land CP: Green Helmet IconNaval CP: Blue Anchor IconAir CP: Red Aircraft IconFog of WarFog of War (FoW) represents areas of the battlefield that the player can not see, it is shown by a dark shroud over a hex. Any hex that is not within the Line of Sight (LoS) of a friendly unit is considered to be in Fog of War and any enemy unit within the FoW will not be visible. At the start of each turn, a player's units will reveal the FoW of any hex within their LoS and view distance, view distance is determined by the terrain types. When a unit is moved, it will reveal all hexes along their movement path and at the end of the turn, any hex no longer within LoS of a friendly unit will be covered by FoW.Enemy units that attack from within the FoW will automatically be revealed for the remainder of their turn. Some units, such as submarines and commandos, can be invisible to the enemy even when the hex they are in is not covered by FoW. Additionally, other units positioned in specific terrain can only be spotted when there is an adjacent ground or naval unit.Aircraft and Radar Stations are capable of seeing past their LoS range and thus able to reveal enemy ships or aircraft within the FoW. The hexes past their normal LoS are covered with a lighter shroud and enemy units detected will be identified with an icon rather than a unit model and will not show their unit type or strength.Aircraft MaintenanceAir units need fuel to continue flying and when they run low will need to be refueled at an airfield. Next to an air unit's strength will be a number showing the number of turns before the plane needs to be refueled, when this number reaches 0, the unit will begin losing strength each turn until it refuels.Refueling can be done by landing in an airfield for one turn, additional carrier-based aircraft can land on an aircraft carrier. Landing an aircraft can be done by moving the aircraft to a hex adjacent to an airfield and then clicking on the land button. On the next turn the unit can take off again by selecting the airfield, clicking on the unit, and then selecting a hex adjacent or on the airfield.Float Planes and Flying Boats do not need to be refueled which make them great for doing reconnaissance, but they have few armaments which make them an easy target for enemy aircraft.UnitsUnits CategoriesThere are three different unit categories, each category determines what hexes the unit is capable of moving on.Land Units: Can only move on land hexes.Air Units: Can move across any hex on the map when airborne.Naval Units: Can only move on water hexes.Unit ClassesUnit categories are subdivided into unit classes which determine what roles are suitable to a unit type.Infantry: Infantry are generally the bulk of a player's force. These units do well in terrain with good cover, such as cities, forests, and mountains; while in open terrain, they make easy prey to artillery and armored units. They move slowly on their own, but when equipped with a transport will have faster movement.Reconnaissance: Recon units are great for scouting out enemy positions due to their high movement values and the ability to split their total movement points into two separate moves within one turn. They can also be useful for taking out weakened enemy units, especially those that have retreated behind their lines. Land-based recon units are also more likely to retreat when attacked to give them a higher chance of survival.Tank: Tanks consist of any type of armored combat vehicle and can fight against multiple unit types. Tanks fight best when in open ground, while in heavy cover they will be vulnerable to enemy infantry. They can fight against both infantry and tanks, and even help overrun enemy defenses.Anti-Tank: AT weapons are designed for destroying tanks and can provide fire support to adjacent friendly units when those are attacked by enemy tanks. While great against tanks, they are vulnerable to enemy infantry attacks.Artillery: Artillery are useful for bombarding enemy units from a distance and lowering their efficiency. They tend to be fairly inaccurate and thus do not inflict a lot of direct damage. Towed artillery units are slow on their own, but can be provided with transports to increase their movement. Self-propelled artillery are capable of moving at a faster rate and firing in the same turn.Anti-Air: AA guns are useful for fighting off air units from the ground and thus can provide that much needed protection to a player's other ground units. Like AT weapons, AA guns can provide support fire to friendly units, but against enemy air units. Some AA guns are also capable of switching between an AA mode and an AT mode, acting as either class.Fighter: Fighters are great for taking down enemy planes and gaining air superiority, with some types designed to fight against enemy fighters, while others are designed to take down strategic bombers. Fighters can also provide fire support to a friendly bomber, land or naval unit, when they are attacked by enemy planes. Fighters can be used to attack ground and naval units, but are often ineffective in doing so, unless specifically designed for it.Tactical Bomber: Tactical bombers are capable of dealing damage to enemy ground and naval units. Some carry torpedoes which are useful against naval targets, but take time to reload; while others carry bombs which can be used against both land and naval units. Some bombers even have the ability to switch between torpedoes and bombs, but only when landed at an airfield or carrier.Strategic Bomber: Strategic bombers are similar to artillery in that they are capable of lowering an enemy unit's efficiency but do not provide a lot of direct damage. These bombers fly at much higher altitudes than tactical bombers and thus make them difficult to take down, often requiring specialized fighters or AA guns to do so. Strategic bombers can also bomb enemy supply sources, lowering the supply output.Destroyer: Destroyers are cheap and fast, and thus often taken in large numbers. This makes them ideal for scouting and screening a fleet's larger ships. Destroyers also carry torpedoes which can deliver deadly blows to large enemy warships, sonar which can be used to spot submerged enemy submarines, and depth charges to destroy submarines.Cruiser: Cruisers are fast, medium-sized warships which are good for escorting important targets. Cruisers also have AA guns to fend off enemy air attacks. They are slightly slower than destroyers but can deal out more damage to enemy ships.Battleship: Battleships are the largest and most powerful ships in the game, but are also the most expensive as a result. They can attack enemy ground and naval units from a large distance and against ground units will act like artillery, causing efficiency loss instead of direct damage. Battleships are completely incapable of fighting enemy submarines, thus requiring destroyers to protect them from such threats.Carrier: Carriers are mobile airfields on the water and can maintain carrier-based aircraft. Carriers are great for supporting naval encounters and beach landing when there are no land-based airfields nearby. Carriers come in different sizes and can store anywhere from one to three air units depending on its size.Submarine: Submarines are naval units which can move and attack while submerged, thus making them hard to spot. While submerged, only enemy ships with sonar will be able to reveal and attack a submarine.Structures: Structures are incapable of moving and consist of units that can attack and have strong defenses or passive units that serve various functions.Transports: Transports are units that are attached to other units such as infantry or towed weapons to increase their movement. Transports can be land, air, naval, or even railroad based.Mines: Mines are immovable units that once deployed, belong to neither side. Mines can only be spotted by an adjacent unit of the same type as the mine and once spotted will remain visible. Mines can only be removed by moving a unit through them, which will deal damage to that unit; or by using the Mine Clearing ability of a unit that has it.Unit StatsEach unit has a set of stats that determine how effective a unit is at a number of things.Strength: Strength is essentially a unit's health, it represents how many men are in a unit. During combat strength is reduced, and it can be replenished using the Repair abilities. The higher the strength, the more damage a unit is capable of doing in combat; and when it is reduced to 0, the unit is destroyed.Entrenchment: Entrenchment represents how well a unit has prepared defenses in a given location. If a unit remains stationary and does not attack it will prepare defenses on its current position making the unit more resistant to attack.Experience: Experience represents how much a unit has learned from its time in the field. It will increase over time as a unit fights, and more experienced units are better in combat and thus more difficult to destroy.Chassis: Chassis tells how a unit moves, whether that be by foot, tracks, or wheels for land units; or for naval units, shallow draft, deep draft, and submerged. Chassis type determines how well a unit can move through different terrain types or water depths.Movement Points: Movement points represent how quickly a unit can move. These are used up as a unit moves, depending on their chassis and the terrain they move through.Line of Sight (LoS): Represents the view range of a unit, each terrain type has a LoS cost which determine how far away in a given direction each unit will be able to see.Range: How far a unit can shoot. A unit with a range of 0 needs to be adjacent to the enemy unit and be able to enter that terrain type in order to attack.Attack: Each unit type has a series of attack values for each unit category that are used when it attacks this category.Defense: Each unit type has a series of defense values for each unit category that are used when it is attacked by this category.Offensive Combat Type (OCT): The defense stat that is used by the enemy when this unit attacks.Defensive Combat Type (OCT): The attack stat that is used by the enemy when it attack this unit.Bombardment: Represents how much damage can be done when a strategic bomber attacks a supply source.Shock: Represents how much efficiency an enemy unit will lose when it is bombarded by this unit.Assault: Represents how much damage a unit will do to enemy entrenchment at the beginning of their attack.Downloadable ContentBattle of Britain ModThe Battle of Britain Mod was released as a free update for Order of Battle: World War II on September 15, 2015 to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain.The Battle of Britain mod feature two scenarios, Unit Demonstration and the Battle of Britain.Unit DemonstrationThis scenario introduces the player to the new units that have been added as part of the Battle of Britain Mod.Battle of BritainThis scenario is the main scenario of the mod, featuring the historical Battle of Britain, the map includes southern England and the northern French, Belgian and Dutch coasts. Players command the Royal Air Force and are given the objective to keep the British morale up while simultaneously diminishing the German morale.British morale is kept up by protecting the British supply ships which make their way through the English Channel and through the Thames River to London, and by protecting British cities from German air raids. German morale can be lowered by destroying German bombers and disrupting their plans for Operation Sea Lion.Secondary objectives include protecting the radar stations along the southern coast of England, destroying German Stuka bombers, and taking out a coastal gun battery.Morning SunMorning Sun is the first expansion pack for Order of Battle: World War II which takes place during the Second Sino-Japanese War and allows players to command the Japanese as they invade China in 11 new scenarios. It also includes new features such as the ability for players to construct small airstrips where they choose, horse transportation and cavalry units, new terrain types, and many new units.U.S. MarinesU.S. Marines is the second expansion pack for Order of Battle: World War II. The expansion allows players to control the U.S. Marines in the island hopping campaign in the Pacific Theatre of World War II, between 1942-1945. It includes the following scenarios: Tulagi, Guadalcanal, Munda Point, Blissful & Goodtime, Bougainville, Gilbert Islands, Marshall Islands, Saipan, Guam, Palau, and Iwo Jima; as well as some new units.Winter WarWinter War is the third expansion pack which includes the Winter War (1939-1940), the Continuation War (1941-1944), and the Lapland War (1944-1945). Players get to take control of the Finnish Army with supporting troops from either Germany or the Soviet Union depending on the outcomes. The expansion also includes over 90 new units, and a new climate: winter, making movement across the terrain slow and difficult.Rising SunRising Sun is one of two campaigns that were originally included in Order of Battle: Pacific and later released as an expansion pack when the game was renamed and became free. In Rising Sun, players command the forces of Imperial Japan starting at Pearl Harbor and continue on through both historic and theoretical scenarios in an attempt to change history and win the war as Japan.U.S. PacificU.S. Pacific is one of two campaigns that were originally included in Order of Battle: Pacific and later released as an expansion pack when the game was renamed and became free.

A mobile version of the game is in the works, but a spokesperson for the company did not give details on any release dates.Though the game's first release was on steam and could only be played on PC, Eternal Battlefield's UI and monetization system are easily recognizable as built for a mobile experience. It is speculated that the steam version of the game was used as a beta version to iron out any kinks before a mobile launch.GameplayThe object of Eternal Battlefield is the same as any other royale-style game: be the last team standing. Four teams of 2 players compete in an arena that slowly shrinks as the game progresses. Players start with a hero and four units. The hero follows the player's cursor while the army follows the hero. Using the automatic attacks of the units, the player must go around killing neutral creeps or enemy units scattered across the arena, all of whom provide ""souls"" and xp.There are two types of summon in Eternal Battlefield:Respawn - Lose all souls stored from unit kills and summon soldiers based on the souls stored up to a supply cap (based on level). The type of units spawned from this technique is random.Recruit - Spend Money to summon units of your choice. A unique version of the unit sporting stronger stats is summoned along with the normal units.Only units of the appropriate level may be summoned using either technique.Although the hero does not attack, its ""hero ability"" is unlocked at level 4.Unit SetupThere are 3 races to choose from: Elves, Undead and Humans. After selecting a race, 7 slots are available to the player to customize their army, each with 2 options. The hero slot notwithstanding, starting from the left, every subsequent slot holds more powerful units than the last.Each unit has both ""normal"" stats and stats that belong to their unique version. When upgrading units using the meta summon feature, only the unique versions of units are upgraded.",,,,,,,,,

He returns to find that his friend is missing, his closest ally is now his greatest enemy, and the gang he used to work for wants him dead. When Kazuma learns about the disappearance of 10 billion yen and meets a mysterious young girl, he gets involved in a massive conspiracy that threatens his life at every turn.CombatThe combat in Yakuza mainly focuses on hand-to-hand brawling, with a selection of weapons. Fights progress by combining light attacks with heavy attacks, throws, and dodges. When Kazumaâs Heat bar fills up, he is allowed to unleash special attacks with weapons, or perform equally brutal ground attacks. By finishing opponents with one of Kazumaâs Heat moves, extra experience points will be rewarded. These points can be used to increase Kazumaâs Soul, Technique, and Body level. Soul affects the Heat meter, Technique, the player's move set, and Body, Kazuma's health. Teachers scattered around the area can also help Kazuma by teaching him additional moves, otherwise unattainable by normal leveling.Free RoamWhen not on a mission, Kazuma is allowed to go anywhere within Kamurocho, the district of Tokyo in which the majority of the game is based. He can go to various fast food outlets, convenience stores, and other miscellaneous locales such as casinos, Club Sega, and Don Quijote. During free roam, random battles will occur in which gangsters, street punks, and drunken office workers will start a fight. Coin locker keys are found all around the city, and they allow access to a multitude of items. Kazuma can also use taxis to move across the city, as a form of fast travel.ActivitiesWhile exploring the city, Kazuma can take part in various activities in order to obtain extra money and items. These include an underground casino which offers blackjack tables & roulette wheels, a batting cage, cage fighting, hostess bars, and UFO catcher machines. People on the street will also offer jobs to Kazuma which usually involve beating someone up. Thus, time spent on the streets of Kamurocho is rarely dull.HD EditionOn the 13th, July 2012, Sega announced that Yakuza 1 and 2 will receive a high definition facelift in the form of the bundle; Yakuza 1&2 HD Collection. The HD update will have the game running at 1080p (whereas the Yakuza games that use the Yakuza 3 engine run in 720p.) It also includes minor improvements such as marking the menu items that you've already purchased in restaurants and so fourth.It was released in Japan on the 1st, November 2012.

Â Other than characters and spells that are from the Magic the Gathering Universe, this game has very little in common with the card game. Â For example, the card game is turn based, while this game is real time.StoryThree duelists fought an epic battle against one another. Â The powerful Planeswalker Mishra was almost defeated when The Black Spider, Tsabo Tavoc, revealed that the two of them were secretly allied with each other. Working together they defeated the third unnamed duelist. Â As Mishra was claiming his prize of the unnamed duelist's gems they fly off and spread throughout the land.Â Â Â You play the part of an unnamed protagonist who is sent out by your mentor to find these gems to defeat Mishra and Tsabo Tavoc.GameplayMagic the Gathering: Battlegrounds has a very fast, in depth, and unique gameplay style. Â The battles in the game take place between 2Â duelistsÂ in an arena that is divided in half down the center. Â Similar to the card games players require mana to summon creatures and cast spells. Â However, unlike the card game the duelists can attack or summon at any given time during the battle.Â Mana is gained in orbs which take an extra 3 seconds to obtain with each orb the player gains. Â So while it takes 45 seconds to obtain 5 orbs, it will take 2 minutes and 45 seconds to reach 10 orbs. Mana will regenerate over time after a spell has been cast, mana shards can also be collected from defeated creatures to refill the mana bar quicker. Â Â Â Game ModesÂ Quest mode: which serves as an extensive tutorial.Â Arcade mode: in which 2 players can customise their decks and compete against each other in a variety of different arenasÂ The game also featured online one on one matches over xbox live.ArenasPlayers can choose from five different schools of magic-  Plains Island Forest Swamp Mountain ",,,,,,,,,

With the money left, the crucial part of a festival is the next thing on the agenda: Booking bands. The final thing to do is to set up ticket prices and make sure this fine selection of musicians gets the crowd they deserve!After all that is done, there is nothing left to do as to open up the doors and await all the fans. Now the planning capabilities of the player will really stand out. Are there enough toilets? Will the food be enough? Did the player install enough security and medical stations? All these questions will be answered within the live play part. If everything runs smooth, the festival will be a huge success, giving the player the opportunity to create an even bigger festival next season. With the profit of the last festival, there can be better and more popular bands on larger stages and more exclusive locations. One day, the gigs will even be broadcasted to live-TV, allowing the player to host festivals which the world has never seen before.But this is a long way and planning can be difficult. If things do not work as well as hoped for, the player will have to sort things out by hand. Dealing with security issues or pumping-out full toilets and all the things necessary to make the best out of the situation. This will probably not be a completely financial ruin, but fans and sponsors will remember next season how bad the organization was, and the reputation of the players company will suffer. Core Game Mechanics:Build Part- Plan the festival area to fit the needs of the fans and bands.- Book fitting bands, based on similar genres and create stage schedules, matching the needs of the bands.- Set ticket prices and find the sweet spot between revenue and visitor count.- Sign broadcast contracts and provide the necessary equipment.- Find sponsors, they provide money but require services in return.- Buy insurances and be safe if something doesn't work as expected.- Hire professionals, they allow better micromanagement of certain elements.- Create ad-campaigns and find partner festivals to increase the visitor count.Live Part- Make your guests happy and provide all required amenities for your bands.- Handle your staff and make sure everything is running smoothly.- Watch the stages and enjoy your personal festival.",,,,,,,,,

Outside of combat, the party moves between areas in the style of a text adventure. In combat, the party members and enemies take turns moving on a square grid.The gameplay combines RPG elements with an adventure game style text-parser interface and Chess/Shogi/Go style tactical turn-based combat.One of its most interesting features was its combat system: Following a random encounter, the game transitions from a text adventure interface to a separate battle screen, where a tactical turn-based combat system is used, a year before Ultima III: Exodus.LegacyIn addition to being the first known Japanese computer RPG, this game can also be considered a precursor to the tactical RPG genre, followed by titles such as Koei's own Nobunaga's Ambition in 1983, ASCII's Bokosuka Wars and Origin's Ultima III in 1983, and Nintendo's popular Fire Emblem series from 1990 onwards.The game's designer, Koei founder Kou Shibusawa, remarked in a later interview that he did not consider early efforts such as this to be ""authentic"" fantasy RPG's. Nevertheless, this early hybrid approach to RPG design paved the way for the emergence of new RPG sub-genres in Japan: the action RPG (with the Dragon Slayer series) and the tactical RPG (with the games mentioned above).External linkDark Age of JRPGs (1): The Dragon & Princess (1982), Hardcore Gaming 101  ",,,,,,,,,

1468800,Portal Defect,0,Gin Motion,Gin Motion,0,0,0,"Action, Casual, Indie",English,,," Introduction: Just the right amount of thoom, but no more.An interdiction cruiser: triangle-shaped ships are novel, right?Defect is a game where a player builds many almost-supreme ships, as the central conceit of the game is to defeat the player's old ship at the end of every level. Take, for example, a completely original ""interdiction cruiser"" (from a beta quite a few months ago). Each part is placed around a central core, sized, rotated, and powered to achieve some desired objective of space, design, and thoom. (Not to mention pew! pew! and ka-zorch.)The game iterates between ship-building and mission-playing. Each mission demands different characteristics of the designed ship in terms of manoeuvrability, weapons range and load-out, and enemies -- not to mention the inevitability of facing the previous mission's ""invincible"" ship.Gameplay: Build ships, fly around, shoot things, focus on different bits.The game has a fairly simple build-shoot-reward gameplay loop. Missions grow more complex, ships grow more complex, and the options... grow more complex.Building ships: It's all about the coreOW68 Robo Gap Missile Boat: almost but not quite entirely worthless.The OW68 Robo Gap (names and designations are generated randomly) pictured here is a completely representative early game ""The player has attempted this mission too many times to care about aesthetics"" ship. The centrepoint of the ship is the core, which provides limits on the amount of energy available. Exposed cores provide more energy at the cost of being really easy to blow up. Sometimes this ""defect"" is an advantage.The cores need to connect to the rest of the ship. If components overlap, they lose efficiency. The OW68 uses a very cheap connector-piece scaled up to be it's primary hull. The connector-piece is very flimsy but very energy efficient. Design then proceeds by spending energy on weapons, engines, stabilizers, and crew modules. Everything can be rotated and (to a point) sized to taste. This ship is a very bad ship, but it's very representative of the iterative design process some of the tougher missions almost require a player to do.Flying around and Shooting things: All defects in design are features -- not bugs.Manoeuvrability is far more important than firepower in 95% of this mission.Different ships have different weapon and flight characteristics suited for different environments. All problems are the fault of the designer (the player) and the fault of the pilot (the player) and the fault of the enemies and the player's prior ship (the player fifteen minutes ago). There is nuance here because different sub-systems can be controlled (and repaired) through direct player action, allowing heightened efficiency on the bit that the player is focusing on at the moment. Guns, focused upon, allow manual fire and aim. Engines go faster. Stabilisers provide more nuanced maneuvering, and so on.Defeating the prior shipThe wonderful ""End Mission"" button on a bug-eyed ship. (The bug-eyes are really really good lasers)The end of (almost) every level is the appearance and (probable) destruction of the player's prior ship. Different players have different means of introducing weak points into the ship, but making sure that the ship is horribly slow if it doesn't have focused-upon engines, or doesn't aim well without human intervention is a feature, not a bug. The ""handy exhaust port"" on the death star is a similar ""feature."" This twist allows the game to require innovation in building in every level, instead of occasional building when new parts become available. ",,,,,,,,,

This is not due to adult content, or anything within the game itself, but rather to the use of the word ""EDGE"" as the title. The game itself has won countless awards for almost every aspect of the game, including the prestigious Milthon award for Best Mobile Game in Paris, and the IMGA (International Mobile Game Award) at the mobile world congress in Barcelona.GameplayEDGE is a platforming game with grid-based movement. You control a cube which must make it to the exit of each level while collecting smaller, colorful cubes called ""prisms"". Collecting prisms increases the movement speed of your cube. Scoring is based on the time to complete an individual level as well as the percentage of prisms collected. Like many other games, EDGE makes use of an S-Rank if you perform flawlessly in a level.Final releases of the game came with over 40 levels, as well as unlockable levels upon collecting all the cubes in each of the main levels. Some of the levels imitate light themes from classic games, or make use of optical illusions to twist the players perception (as the camera is isometric and not directly controlled by the player). There are no enemies in the game but levels commonly include dynamic elements such as buttons, moving tiles or obstacles which may cause an unwary player to fall off the edge of the level. Doing so results in a restart from various invisible check points. Time continues during and after death, making a perfect playthrough the best way to complete a level for S-Rank. There are also more advanced techniques such as balancing the cube halfway to 'hang' on an edge, or using special tiles to shrink your cube and allow it to climb vertical surfaces or fit through smaller areas.You control the cube on the iPhone by swiping and holding your finger in the direction you want it to move, anywhere on the screen. EDGE was the very first game on the App Store to implement this type of touch control. The PC version can be controlled with a keyboard or controller, which can cause confusion as the cube moves diagonally relative to the keys pressed.ControversyLegal IssuesOn April 7th, 2009, the founder of Mobigame, David Papazian, received an email from Apple stating that his game had been reported as infringing on a copyright for the word ""Edge"", and that it would be removed from the App Store. Soon after, he send the owner of the trademark for ""EDGE"", Tim Langdel an email, hoping to work out the issue personally. The following are excerpts of the two initial emails, quoted from an in-depth article posted by Eurogamer on August 3, 2009.""We chose the name Edge because it reflects the game's style: the cube you navigate through levels is always hanging on the edge. I did not know about your company or your games before. Please believe me that we did not intend to pass our game off as one of yours in any way.""Tim Langdel replied with the following:""I am a strong supporter of innovation in games... It is not our intention to do anything other than encourage originality in games and to encourage new game makers. But the problem is that using the trademark 'EDGE' for a game is a direct infringement of our international rights. We have spent a lot of time (and a large amount of money) stopping everyone who tries to use the mark EDGE [for a] game. You wouldn't think of using 'Activision' as the name of a game would you? Even though there has never been a game called Activision. Or 'Electronic Arts' or 'Nintendo'? No, all these names are so closely associated with the name of the company, you would not be permitted to use them for a game without the express permission of the trademark owner... It is the same with EDGE.""These emails sparked what has become one of the most publicized legal battles involving an independent game developer in recent history. On one side of the fence, Langdell claims that he has full rights to using the word ""EDGE"" in any game setting, and that the game itself is very similar to his 1986 title ""Bobby Bearing"". He stated that he offered that Mobigame simply change the name to ""EDGY"", but registered the US trademark for ""EDGY"" soon after making the suggestion.According to David, he had tried to work with Tim through multiple emails, but essentially was unable to reach an agreement on the trademark infringement. Both parties have reported conflicting stories as to what actually took place, and evidence supporting both sides has gone public in various forms; generally email communications.Public OpinionWhile the legal battle between Mobigame and Edge Games has been going for quite some time, no verdict has been reached on the matter. However, public opinion on the matter has been overwhelmingly on the side of David Papazian. This could be due to Mobigame being the ""underdog"" in this matter; the independent studio going up against an established company. However, several popular gaming news sites who reported on the events, such as Kotaku and Eurogamer, mentioned numerous cases in the past where Langdell had aggressively sought out legal action against other developers who tried to use the word ""edge"" in their game title or other platforms. This includes major publisher Namco, who was planning on releasing their game, Soul Edge, in the US at the time. Namco ended up changing the name of the game to ""Soul Blade"" in the US to avoid complications.Multiple Apps Store ReleasesDuring the period of legal actions from and against Mobigame, EDGE has been released and removed several times on the App Store. The game was released in December, 2008, but was pulled several months later in May 2009 after Apple received the warning about the copyright violations. After no settlement was made between Mobigame and Edge Games, EDGE was approved by Apple and returned to the app store on October 7, 2009 as ""Edge by Mobigame"". Despite the change in name, the game was pulled again just a few weeks later on November 26th.Mobigame then released the game a 3rd time under the name ""EDGY"" a few days later on December 1. Soon after, it was pulled again, this time by Mobigame, who was worried the release would be used in Langdell's case against EA. Currently, EDGE/EDGY cannot be found in the US or UK App stores, but is still available in other countries. The only game currently available by Mobigame in the US and UK is Cross Fingers.EA's InvolvementIn September of 2009, Electronic Arts Entertainment filed a Petition for Cancellation against several ""Edge"" trademarks. EA states that the word ""Edge"" has not actively been used in any recent commerce from the company. This came a few months after Langdell had threatened legal action against EA for using the same word in their ""Mirror's Edge"" series of games.As of March, 2010, reports from Edge Games, Langdell's game company, state that they are ""completely confident"" they will win the legal battles with both Mobigame and EA. Below is an excerpt from a press release by Edge Games concerning the matter:""Bottom line, we are the oldest remaining British game company, and one of the oldest remaining US game companies doesn't like the fact there is still one UK company older than itself that they have not yet destroyed. And they wont succeed. False rumours, misinformation and defamation never won any trademark case and it wont this time, either.IGDA InvolvementTim Langdell was inducted onto the board at the International Game Developers Association in March of 2009. After the events and accusations of Langdell's alleged involvement in ""trademark trolling"" smaller independent developers, including Mobigame, an internal petition to members of the IGDA called for a vote to remove him. While the IGDA did not directly start the petition, a meeting was called for October, 3, 2009 to consider the action. Tim resigned from the board in August, 2009.ResolutionOn April 17th, 2013, the legal battle finally reached a conclusion when a California judge formally cancelled Langdell's ownership of the trademark after all legal hurdles in the way of EA's petition for cancellation originally filed in 2009 had been cleared.System RequirementsPC RequirementsMinimum:OS:Windows XPProcessor:Intel Pentium 4 / AMD Athlon XP 1.5 Ghz or higherMemory:512 MB RAMGraphics:DirectX 9 compatible, 64MB VRAMDirectXÂ®:dx90cHard Drive:100 MB HD spaceRecommended:Memory:1 GB RAMDirectXÂ®:dx90cMac RequirementsMinimum:OS:OS X 10.5 (Leopard)Processor:IntelMemory:512 MB RAMHard Drive:100 MB HD spaceRecommended:Memory:1 GB RAM",,,,,,,,,

As the player progresses through the level the creatures they will face will have more health, the way they destroy the creatures is by having more powerful towers.GameplayTowersExample of using Pellet Towers for blocking the wayPellet Tower - These are the basic tower and can attack both ground and air creatures. They can eventually be upgraded to a Sniper Tower. Usually these are used for maze building, as they are the cheapest tower.Squirt Tower - These are quick firing towers that can attack both land and air creatures. They can eventually be upgraded to a Typhoon TowerDart Tower - These are slow firing towers that can only attack land creatures. They can eventually be upgraded to a ICBM TowerSwarm Tower - This is a fast firing tower which fires 4 missiles and can only fire at air creatures. They can eventually be upgraded to a Storm TowerFrost Tower - This tower slows creatures down when they fire a missile at them, it can hit multiple creatures with one shot. They can eventually be upgraded to a Blizzard TowerBash Tower - This tower only damages the ground around it, when it attacks it has a chance to stun the creatures so they can not move. They can eventually be upgraded to a Quake TowerInk Tower - This tower has a maximum and minimum range, the tower shoots blobs of ink at the ground which damages creatures when they walk over it. They can eventually be upgraded to a Ink-Blot TowerSnap Tower - This tower fires only once and damages an area around it, the tower can attack both land and air. They can eventually be upgraded to a Spike TowerBoost Tower - This tower does not shoot but instead boosts the damage of the towers around it.CreepsCreeps are the enemies you have to kill. They give player extra money after being killed, allowing him/her to build or upgrade towers.The DS versionNormal - Just normal creeps, nothing special.Immune - Like normal, but won't be slowed by Frost Towers.Group - All creeps are packed together.Fast - Like name says, they are fast.Spawn - When killed, 2 lower health creeps come out. (In case of boss version, the creeps divide again)Flying - These creeps fly over towers, won't be shoot at by ground-only towers.Dark - These creeps have armor, reducing damage they take from towers.Morph - They change between above creep types (expect flying) after some time. There are boss versions of above creeps, when 1 of given type (expect group, in which case 3) come out from entrances. They have increased health and value.DS VersionA Nintendo DS version, developed by  Frima Studio in conjunction with  THQ, was released in May 2009. It featured new graphics (from DTD 1.9, which was in development at the time), a simple art editor (in which player can draw creeps and towers) and an in-game achievement system.Links Desktop Tower Defense - home of the game, most versions to date can be played here.

Sam & Max Save the World consists of six episodes:Episode 1: Culture Shock Episode 2: Situation: ComedyEpisode 3: The Mole, the Mob, and the MeatballEpisode 4: Abe Lincoln Must Die!Episode 5: Reality 2.0Episode 6: Bright Side of the MoonDistributionSam and Max Season One was initially distributed through GameTap, a subscription based PC gaming service, and followed by a worldwide release through Telltale Games' own website 15 days later. The series also saw a full release on  Valve's Steam distribution service. A Wii version of the game was announced on April 4th 2008, and is a port of its PC counterpart, albeit with integrated motion controls. On February 26th 2009, Telltale announced the game would be released on XBLA with the new name of 'Sam & Max: Save the World' (rather than ""Sam & Max Season One""), which released on June 17 of the same year.Episode 4, ""Abe Lincoln Must Die!"", was made released for free through both  Steam and  Telltale's website, to promote the season. Following Telltale's closure, the game can no longer be downloaded from their website. As well, the episode's original store page is no longer accessible, however the episode can still be installed using Steam's install command.On December 2, 2020, a remaster of Sam & Max Save the World was released on Steam, GOG, and Nintendo Switch. The remaster was created by Skunkape Games, a team comprised of former Telltale developers who had acquired the rights to Sam & Max as well as source materials from the game's original release. As well as remastering the game's visuals, the new release features reworked dialogue, alongside consulting from Sam & Max cartoonist Steve Purcell to guide the game's visuals and humor. Following the release of the game's remaster, the original Sam & Max Save the World was de-listed from Steam, however the original version of Save the World was reintroduced as free DLC for the remaster.GameplayThe primary gameplay in Sam and Max consists of leisurely walking around the Freelance Police officers' office and its city surroundings, such as a continuously career changing lady friend's office, Bosco's Inconvenience Store and various other locations, depending on the episode. Players are tasked with solving puzzles and answering riddles to advance the game's story, which shoots for the comical stars. Bosco's in Reality 2.0.Pointing and clicking on an area allows the player to move Sam (Max follows without getting in the way), while ""clicking/button pressing"" examines specific objects, and adds them to your inventory as necessary. Items are often needed for later puzzles, so combining certain collected goods and inserting, dropping, or applying them to things will usually solve a good chunk of the game's puzzles. From Sam's revolver to a slice of cheese, the variety of collectibles is ridiculously varied.There is also a driving component of the game, where the player controls the gas and side-to-side motion of Sam's police cruiser, while simultaneously integrating a combat mechanic using Sam's revolver. Shooting out baddies tires completes certain objectives, and also garners some angry remarks from civilian traffic. Innocents can be pulled over for speeding (or a busted tail light, should you decide to shoot it out) if players bore of driving aimlessly.The dialogue system heavily influences the story, though in a linear fashion. Sam and Max will need to be quick on the tongue with witty dialogue to get the info they need, or out of a dilemma. Many puzzles center around this conversation mechanic, such as talking down crazed enemies, and immense trickery!",,,,,,,,,

Outside of combat, the party moves between areas in the style of a text adventure. In combat, the party members and enemies take turns moving on a square grid.The gameplay combines RPG elements with an adventure game style text-parser interface and Chess/Shogi/Go style tactical turn-based combat.One of its most interesting features was its combat system: Following a random encounter, the game transitions from a text adventure interface to a separate battle screen, where a tactical turn-based combat system is used, a year before Ultima III: Exodus.LegacyIn addition to being the first known Japanese computer RPG, this game can also be considered a precursor to the tactical RPG genre, followed by titles such as Koei's own Nobunaga's Ambition in 1983, ASCII's Bokosuka Wars and Origin's Ultima III in 1983, and Nintendo's popular Fire Emblem series from 1990 onwards.The game's designer, Koei founder Kou Shibusawa, remarked in a later interview that he did not consider early efforts such as this to be ""authentic"" fantasy RPG's. Nevertheless, this early hybrid approach to RPG design paved the way for the emergence of new RPG sub-genres in Japan: the action RPG (with the Dragon Slayer series) and the tactical RPG (with the games mentioned above).External linkDark Age of JRPGs (1): The Dragon & Princess (1982), Hardcore Gaming 101  ",,,,,,,,,

It was initially released into Early Access December 2, 2016 and is currently set for release Mid 2018.The game is primarily a multiplayer competitive game where players collect cards and use them to summon minions and cast spells in real time. It currently features three game modes, 1v1, 2v2, and Draft, the latter of which is also 1v1 but players are only allowed to use decks crafted from randomized cards.Minion Masters is often compared to popular games such as Clash Royale, but differs in that it is only currently on the PC platform and cards that are collected do not build levels with subsequent copies. GameplayAll game modes use the same mechanics where the each player gains mana over time at a rate that increases from one every three seconds progressive to one every 1.5 seconds. The player has a deck of ten cards, of which four at a time are available. The players are represented on the map by their selected Master avatar that has its own subset of abilities that are either passive or activated by the player in the place of a card. The game always takes place on a battlefield with two bridges.Cards consume a portion of the mana pool defined on the card and can either be summons or spells. Summons can only be played on the side of the bridge of the casting player and move from their location across the map to attack the opponent or his creatures. Other summons are buildings that do not move from the played position. Spells are cards can be played on any area of the playfield and have a variety of effects. Game ModesThe three game modes in available at this time are 1v1, 2v2, and Draft. They all have separate queues the 1v1 and 2v2 modes have separate ranking levels.1v1The 1v1 game mode allows players to face off directly against one another. This is the oldest game mode and the mode that most tournaments follow.2v2This is the most recent game mode addition and randomly assigns players a team mate to face off against another group of two random players that match up with their combined ranking. This is currently the only game mode that allows a player to create a team with another player and compete in ranked play against other pre-made teams.DraftDraft is a buy-in game mode where a player chooses cards from random assortments to create a deck that is used to compete against other randomly-selected decks. Each player tries to win, at most, 12 matches in order to gain win-dependent levels of in-game prizes without losing three total matches in the process. The mode begins with the player selecting from one of three random Masters. Then they are presented with three cards at a time allowing them to choose only one. This is repeated ten times, filling the deck.",,,,,,,,,

1467560,Desktop Panels,399,Knakra,Knakra,0,0,0,"Education, Utilities, Video Production, Early Access",English,,,"OverviewEach game or round consists of one dungeon floor, randomly created, that you must navigate through, gaining levels until you can defeat the boss. As you move more of the dungeon is revealed, allowing you to find hidden treasure or power ups. Once you have defeated the boss, a score screen is shown and any game rewards are given to you. These rewards include new game modes, classes, or races. There is only a single floor to each dungeon, and no persistent characters from dungeon to dungeon. Long term progression in the game comes in the form of collecting gold and unlocking new game elements, which can open up new strategies.Although the game is heavily informed by roguelike design, each level is akin to a tactical puzzle game. The primary way for the player to regain health and mana is by exploring squares; if one uses up this resource recklessly, it is easily possible to lock oneself out of being able to defeat the level's boss. More difficult levels often require more complex strategies, such as targeting monsters of much higher level than the player, or carefully timing a level up to take best advantage of the free health and mana restoration associated with it.VersionsAfter the initial freeware release of the alpha version in 2010, QFC Design turned their efforts toward an enhanced, full version of the game, which they have rewritten in the Unity Engine. The full version was commercially released in 2013 on PC, Mac, and Linux with iOS and Android ports following.The full version features enhanced graphics and expanded gameplay. It uses a world map with multiple dungeons, and each of these dungeons contain distinguishing features, such as different level layouts and different selections of monsters. This provides a much expanded selection compared to the level types available in the alpha. The player undertakes a series of quests to unlock new dungeons, as well as items, classes, races, altars and other features. Dungeons may now include sub-dungeons, branches that often contain rewards or puzzles. A ""preparation"" system was introduced in the beta, which allows the player to spend gold in exchange for certain advantages at the start of a dungeon run. The preparation system includes item banks, which allow the player to store items they have found and reuse them in later dungeons.Due to extensive rebalancing, some gameplay elements including class abilities and gods now operate quite differently in the full version, compared to their counterparts in the freeware version.AvailabilityThe alpha version of the game is freeware and is currently available for download at desktopdungeons.net.The full version of the game is now available for purchase on Steam and on the the creator's website. The game retails for $14.99 and was officially released on November 7th 2013.RacesNameDescriptionUnlocked at...

GameplayThe player controls A.R.I.D., a combat suit AI, in a side-scrolling action/adventure game.A.R.I.D. can use a flashlight to highlight certain objects in the environment, some of which she can interact with. The game utilizes an inventory system, which has to be used to solve many of the game's puzzles. The puzzles consist mainly of item combinations, environmentally specific actions and dialog trees.Aside from the puzzles, there are also some action elements mixed into the gameplay. A.R.I.D. can shoot a gun to fend off enemy security droids, while either taking cover behind objects in the environment or using the camouflage function built into her suit.StoryThe Fall is about A.R.I.D., a female, artificial intelligence system that has been integrated into an armored combat suit. The combat suit A.I. becomes activated, and autonomous, when the human inside it is rendered unconscious after falling from an undisclosed location into a derelict underground facility.A.R.I.D. awakes in a half-initialized state, with very little control over the suit and its functions. She has to find a way to override some of her main functions if she wants to prevent the human from dying, but has trouble doing so because of her programming.On her journey to save the human, she encounters a friendly mainframe A.I. with a quirky personality, who is trying to help her. Meanwhile, another A.I, the ""Caretaker"", tries to stop A.R.I.D. The Caretaker interrogates A.R.I.D., finding her programming faulty. Through the rest of the game, the Caretaker stalks A.R.I.D. and tries to shut her down for de-purposing.",,,,,,,,,

Order of Battle: World War II features turn-based, hex-based tactical gameplay set in World War II. It has a 3D game map with detailed animations and effects, over 700 different units, unique commanders that can be attached to the player's units, and 20 different specializations to give a unique feel to the player's army. Order of Battle: World War II also includes multiplayer with up to 4 players using its PBEM++ system and an in-game scenario editor.The game was originally released as Order of Battle: Pacific on April 30, 2015 and included what are now the Rising Sun and U.S. Pacific DLCs. On June 14, 2016, the game was renamed to Order of Battle: World War II and became free to play, with the two original campaigns becoming DLC.Order of Battle: World War II includes the Boot Camp tutorial campaign and allows players to play the first scenario of any DLC campaign. In order for players to unlock the scenario editor and multiplayer with all of the factions, only a single DLC needs to be purchased.GameplaySingle-player modesCampaignPlayers can choose play the Boot Camp campaign and the first scenario of any other campaign for free. Each campaign has a series of linked scenarios that allow a player's core forces to carry over from one to the next. Players can also choose between 5 difficulty levels as listed below under scenario difficulty.Boot Camp: The tutorial, this campaign teaches the player the basics of the game. Players control a group of US recruits in a series of training exercises against another team of US recruits.ScenarioPlayers can play individual scenarios with no core force carryover. A number of additional options are provided for scenario play.Quick Experience: Units gain experience faster than normal, allowing players to obtain elite units within a single scenario.Combat Randomizing: Combat outcome is slightly randomized, thus does not always match the estimated results provided prior to an attack.Custom Starting Force: Allows players to purchase and deploy their own core force instead of using the default force provided by the scenario.Scenario Difficulty: There are five difficulties, I to V, with V being the hardest. Difficulty determines the max unit strength for AI units. These are identical to the ones in campaign play.I: AI max unit strength is 6II: AI max unit strength is 8III: AI max unit strength is 10 (Normal difficulty)IV: AI max unit strength is 12V: AI max unit strength is 13Multiplayer modesHotseatIn hotseat multiplayer, up to 4 players can play in a game on the same device. Players must hand over the controls to the next player when their turn is over.Online PBEM++PBEM++ allows players to play against other players from anywhere in the world over the internet. It requires players to log in to a server in order to play. Play is asynchronous, meaning that both players do not need to be online at the same time; one player can log in, take their turn, and then upload the results to the master server; the server can then notify the other player that it is their turn and that player can take their turn when they are ready.Campaign PlayCampaign mode consists of decisions made on the campaign map, the management of a Core Force, choice of specializations, and scenario play.Campaign MapThe campaign map will display where the campaign is taking place, what territory is controlled by whom, and the next available mission(s) which are represented by pushpins. The campaign map will also allow the player to choose the difficulty level, review any specializations the player may have, and view the player's Core Force.Core ForceUnits purchased during a campaign will be part of the player's Core Force and will be identified on the map by the gold outline of their strength plates. The Core Force will travel with the player throughout the campaign and with the experience they gain throughout the battles, will be the key to victory.Auxiliary units: These are the units that are automatically deployed at the start of a scenario during campaign play and are not part of the player's Core Force. As such these units will not carry over with the player from mission to mission. They are identified by a black outline around the strength plateSpecializationsAt certain points throughout a campaign, a player will be presented with a choice between two specializations. A player may only choose one of the two and will be forced to keep that selection for the remainder of the campaign. Specializations give a player's forces unique abilities and units.Scenario PlayScenario play involves fighting battles and capturing objectives.Briefing and ObjectivesAt the start of most scenarios there will be a briefing sequence which will take the player through the objectives and give the plater a background of the mission. Scenarios will contain two types of objectives, primary and secondary.Primary Objectives: These objectives are mandatory in order to win the scenario.Secondary Objectives: These objectives are optional to complete and doing so will provide bonuses in the current scenario or future scenarios in a campaign.All scenarios will have a turn limit, all primary objectives need to be complete before that limit is over, otherwise the scenario will end in a defeat. Players should also keep in mind that it will not always be possible to complete all secondary objectives within a scenario.Victory & Capture PointsSome hexes will contain flags which mark them as a victory or capture point. There are two types of victory points, primary and secondary, and they are linked to the primary and secondary obectives. Capture points simply represent important locations which can be captured for additional supply and deployment zones, in addition to victory points. When capturing a point, it will take 3 turns before the player will receive supply or before they can deploy from that point. Victory and capture points are represented by the star above the flag.Primary VPs: Marked with a gold star.Secondary VPs: Marked with a silver star.Capture Points (CP): Marked with a bronze star.Hexes & TerritoryAll hexes on the map are controlled by one of the players and can be captured by moving a land or naval unit through them. Air units are unable to capture hexes. The borders of a player's territory are shown by thick red lines which follow the hex edges along the boundary between opposing territories. Hexes with victory or capture points will show the flag of the faction that controls it and isolated hexes of one side containing no units or supply sources will be automatically captured by the enemy if they are completely surrounded.Supply SystemBoth land and air units require a certain amount of supply in order to remain at full efficiency. Without enough supply, units will lose efficiency until their efficiency level matches their supply level. Efficiency level affects how well a unit can defend and attack, their movement, and how quickly they can repair or reinforce.Naval units (excluding carriers) can provide supply by being adjacent to a land hex. Land units draw supply from any land-based supply source or from naval units that are adjacent to a land hex, provided that a player controls the hexes between the unit and the supply sources. Air units draw supply from any airfield on the map, and carrier-based aircraft can also draw supply from aircraft carriers.TerrainAll hexes have a terrain type, and every terrain type has a set of stats that determine its effects on combat. Players can check the stats of a hex by using the terrain information panel.Attacker Combat Factor: Determines the amount of casualties an attacker will inflict on the defender. A higher value means the attacker will inflict more casualties, and a lower value means an attacker will inflict less.Defender Combat Factor: Determines the amount of casualties a defender will inflict on the attacker. Higher is better for the defender, lower is worse for the defender.Cover Rating: The amount of cover that is available from direct fire.Disruption Penalty: The efficiency loss for moving through this terrain.Disembark Penalty: The efficiency loss for disembarking on this terrain.Resource PointsResource points are used for purchasing, upgrading, or repairing units and for certain special abilities. In a scenario, a constant flow of resource points is provided every turn, in addition resource points can be obtained by completing certain objectives and if a scenario is completed before the turn limit is up then the resources that would have been obtained for those remaining turn are automatically obtained. In campaign mode, the resource points that remain at the end of a scenario will transfer over to the next.Command PointsCommand points determine how many more units of a given type are able to be deployed during a given turn in a scenario. Each unit type uses a certain amount of CP when it is deployed and when there are not enough CP then that unit can not be deployed until more are obtained. CP can be gained through completing certain objectives or through the destruction of a unit and auxiliary units do not use CP and thus do not give CP when destroyed. There are 3 types of CP, one for each unit type, each represented by a specific icon.Land CP: Green Helmet IconNaval CP: Blue Anchor IconAir CP: Red Aircraft IconFog of WarFog of War (FoW) represents areas of the battlefield that the player can not see, it is shown by a dark shroud over a hex. Any hex that is not within the Line of Sight (LoS) of a friendly unit is considered to be in Fog of War and any enemy unit within the FoW will not be visible. At the start of each turn, a player's units will reveal the FoW of any hex within their LoS and view distance, view distance is determined by the terrain types. When a unit is moved, it will reveal all hexes along their movement path and at the end of the turn, any hex no longer within LoS of a friendly unit will be covered by FoW.Enemy units that attack from within the FoW will automatically be revealed for the remainder of their turn. Some units, such as submarines and commandos, can be invisible to the enemy even when the hex they are in is not covered by FoW. Additionally, other units positioned in specific terrain can only be spotted when there is an adjacent ground or naval unit.Aircraft and Radar Stations are capable of seeing past their LoS range and thus able to reveal enemy ships or aircraft within the FoW. The hexes past their normal LoS are covered with a lighter shroud and enemy units detected will be identified with an icon rather than a unit model and will not show their unit type or strength.Aircraft MaintenanceAir units need fuel to continue flying and when they run low will need to be refueled at an airfield. Next to an air unit's strength will be a number showing the number of turns before the plane needs to be refueled, when this number reaches 0, the unit will begin losing strength each turn until it refuels.Refueling can be done by landing in an airfield for one turn, additional carrier-based aircraft can land on an aircraft carrier. Landing an aircraft can be done by moving the aircraft to a hex adjacent to an airfield and then clicking on the land button. On the next turn the unit can take off again by selecting the airfield, clicking on the unit, and then selecting a hex adjacent or on the airfield.Float Planes and Flying Boats do not need to be refueled which make them great for doing reconnaissance, but they have few armaments which make them an easy target for enemy aircraft.UnitsUnits CategoriesThere are three different unit categories, each category determines what hexes the unit is capable of moving on.Land Units: Can only move on land hexes.Air Units: Can move across any hex on the map when airborne.Naval Units: Can only move on water hexes.Unit ClassesUnit categories are subdivided into unit classes which determine what roles are suitable to a unit type.Infantry: Infantry are generally the bulk of a player's force. These units do well in terrain with good cover, such as cities, forests, and mountains; while in open terrain, they make easy prey to artillery and armored units. They move slowly on their own, but when equipped with a transport will have faster movement.Reconnaissance: Recon units are great for scouting out enemy positions due to their high movement values and the ability to split their total movement points into two separate moves within one turn. They can also be useful for taking out weakened enemy units, especially those that have retreated behind their lines. Land-based recon units are also more likely to retreat when attacked to give them a higher chance of survival.Tank: Tanks consist of any type of armored combat vehicle and can fight against multiple unit types. Tanks fight best when in open ground, while in heavy cover they will be vulnerable to enemy infantry. They can fight against both infantry and tanks, and even help overrun enemy defenses.Anti-Tank: AT weapons are designed for destroying tanks and can provide fire support to adjacent friendly units when those are attacked by enemy tanks. While great against tanks, they are vulnerable to enemy infantry attacks.Artillery: Artillery are useful for bombarding enemy units from a distance and lowering their efficiency. They tend to be fairly inaccurate and thus do not inflict a lot of direct damage. Towed artillery units are slow on their own, but can be provided with transports to increase their movement. Self-propelled artillery are capable of moving at a faster rate and firing in the same turn.Anti-Air: AA guns are useful for fighting off air units from the ground and thus can provide that much needed protection to a player's other ground units. Like AT weapons, AA guns can provide support fire to friendly units, but against enemy air units. Some AA guns are also capable of switching between an AA mode and an AT mode, acting as either class.Fighter: Fighters are great for taking down enemy planes and gaining air superiority, with some types designed to fight against enemy fighters, while others are designed to take down strategic bombers. Fighters can also provide fire support to a friendly bomber, land or naval unit, when they are attacked by enemy planes. Fighters can be used to attack ground and naval units, but are often ineffective in doing so, unless specifically designed for it.Tactical Bomber: Tactical bombers are capable of dealing damage to enemy ground and naval units. Some carry torpedoes which are useful against naval targets, but take time to reload; while others carry bombs which can be used against both land and naval units. Some bombers even have the ability to switch between torpedoes and bombs, but only when landed at an airfield or carrier.Strategic Bomber: Strategic bombers are similar to artillery in that they are capable of lowering an enemy unit's efficiency but do not provide a lot of direct damage. These bombers fly at much higher altitudes than tactical bombers and thus make them difficult to take down, often requiring specialized fighters or AA guns to do so. Strategic bombers can also bomb enemy supply sources, lowering the supply output.Destroyer: Destroyers are cheap and fast, and thus often taken in large numbers. This makes them ideal for scouting and screening a fleet's larger ships. Destroyers also carry torpedoes which can deliver deadly blows to large enemy warships, sonar which can be used to spot submerged enemy submarines, and depth charges to destroy submarines.Cruiser: Cruisers are fast, medium-sized warships which are good for escorting important targets. Cruisers also have AA guns to fend off enemy air attacks. They are slightly slower than destroyers but can deal out more damage to enemy ships.Battleship: Battleships are the largest and most powerful ships in the game, but are also the most expensive as a result. They can attack enemy ground and naval units from a large distance and against ground units will act like artillery, causing efficiency loss instead of direct damage. Battleships are completely incapable of fighting enemy submarines, thus requiring destroyers to protect them from such threats.Carrier: Carriers are mobile airfields on the water and can maintain carrier-based aircraft. Carriers are great for supporting naval encounters and beach landing when there are no land-based airfields nearby. Carriers come in different sizes and can store anywhere from one to three air units depending on its size.Submarine: Submarines are naval units which can move and attack while submerged, thus making them hard to spot. While submerged, only enemy ships with sonar will be able to reveal and attack a submarine.Structures: Structures are incapable of moving and consist of units that can attack and have strong defenses or passive units that serve various functions.Transports: Transports are units that are attached to other units such as infantry or towed weapons to increase their movement. Transports can be land, air, naval, or even railroad based.Mines: Mines are immovable units that once deployed, belong to neither side. Mines can only be spotted by an adjacent unit of the same type as the mine and once spotted will remain visible. Mines can only be removed by moving a unit through them, which will deal damage to that unit; or by using the Mine Clearing ability of a unit that has it.Unit StatsEach unit has a set of stats that determine how effective a unit is at a number of things.Strength: Strength is essentially a unit's health, it represents how many men are in a unit. During combat strength is reduced, and it can be replenished using the Repair abilities. The higher the strength, the more damage a unit is capable of doing in combat; and when it is reduced to 0, the unit is destroyed.Entrenchment: Entrenchment represents how well a unit has prepared defenses in a given location. If a unit remains stationary and does not attack it will prepare defenses on its current position making the unit more resistant to attack.Experience: Experience represents how much a unit has learned from its time in the field. It will increase over time as a unit fights, and more experienced units are better in combat and thus more difficult to destroy.Chassis: Chassis tells how a unit moves, whether that be by foot, tracks, or wheels for land units; or for naval units, shallow draft, deep draft, and submerged. Chassis type determines how well a unit can move through different terrain types or water depths.Movement Points: Movement points represent how quickly a unit can move. These are used up as a unit moves, depending on their chassis and the terrain they move through.Line of Sight (LoS): Represents the view range of a unit, each terrain type has a LoS cost which determine how far away in a given direction each unit will be able to see.Range: How far a unit can shoot. A unit with a range of 0 needs to be adjacent to the enemy unit and be able to enter that terrain type in order to attack.Attack: Each unit type has a series of attack values for each unit category that are used when it attacks this category.Defense: Each unit type has a series of defense values for each unit category that are used when it is attacked by this category.Offensive Combat Type (OCT): The defense stat that is used by the enemy when this unit attacks.Defensive Combat Type (OCT): The attack stat that is used by the enemy when it attack this unit.Bombardment: Represents how much damage can be done when a strategic bomber attacks a supply source.Shock: Represents how much efficiency an enemy unit will lose when it is bombarded by this unit.Assault: Represents how much damage a unit will do to enemy entrenchment at the beginning of their attack.Downloadable ContentBattle of Britain ModThe Battle of Britain Mod was released as a free update for Order of Battle: World War II on September 15, 2015 to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain.The Battle of Britain mod feature two scenarios, Unit Demonstration and the Battle of Britain.Unit DemonstrationThis scenario introduces the player to the new units that have been added as part of the Battle of Britain Mod.Battle of BritainThis scenario is the main scenario of the mod, featuring the historical Battle of Britain, the map includes southern England and the northern French, Belgian and Dutch coasts. Players command the Royal Air Force and are given the objective to keep the British morale up while simultaneously diminishing the German morale.British morale is kept up by protecting the British supply ships which make their way through the English Channel and through the Thames River to London, and by protecting British cities from German air raids. German morale can be lowered by destroying German bombers and disrupting their plans for Operation Sea Lion.Secondary objectives include protecting the radar stations along the southern coast of England, destroying German Stuka bombers, and taking out a coastal gun battery.Morning SunMorning Sun is the first expansion pack for Order of Battle: World War II which takes place during the Second Sino-Japanese War and allows players to command the Japanese as they invade China in 11 new scenarios. It also includes new features such as the ability for players to construct small airstrips where they choose, horse transportation and cavalry units, new terrain types, and many new units.U.S. MarinesU.S. Marines is the second expansion pack for Order of Battle: World War II. The expansion allows players to control the U.S. Marines in the island hopping campaign in the Pacific Theatre of World War II, between 1942-1945. It includes the following scenarios: Tulagi, Guadalcanal, Munda Point, Blissful & Goodtime, Bougainville, Gilbert Islands, Marshall Islands, Saipan, Guam, Palau, and Iwo Jima; as well as some new units.Winter WarWinter War is the third expansion pack which includes the Winter War (1939-1940), the Continuation War (1941-1944), and the Lapland War (1944-1945). Players get to take control of the Finnish Army with supporting troops from either Germany or the Soviet Union depending on the outcomes. The expansion also includes over 90 new units, and a new climate: winter, making movement across the terrain slow and difficult.Rising SunRising Sun is one of two campaigns that were originally included in Order of Battle: Pacific and later released as an expansion pack when the game was renamed and became free. In Rising Sun, players command the forces of Imperial Japan starting at Pearl Harbor and continue on through both historic and theoretical scenarios in an attempt to change history and win the war as Japan.U.S. PacificU.S. Pacific is one of two campaigns that were originally included in Order of Battle: Pacific and later released as an expansion pack when the game was renamed and became free. In U.S. Pacific, players command the Allied forces led by the US starting at Pearl Harbor and continuing through the historical battles, ending with the Invasion of Japan.System RequirementsPCMinimumOS: Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8Processor: Pentium 4 or equivalentMemory: 2 GB RAMGraphics: 512 MB DirectX 9 video card with shader model 2.0DirectX: Version 9.0cHard Drive: 1 GB available spaceSound Card: DirectX compatible sound cardMacMinimumOS: Mac OS X 10.7+Graphics: DirectX 9 video card with shader model 2.0Hard Drive: 1 GB available space",,,,,,,,,

1466400,Edge Of Dead,0,Inferno Muse Interactive,Inferno Muse Interactive,0,0,0,"Action, Indie",English,,,"OverviewEDGE (known as ""EDGY"" in the US) was, and still is, one of the most controversial titles on the iTunes App Store. This is not due to adult content, or anything within the game itself, but rather to the use of the word ""EDGE"" as the title. The game itself has won countless awards for almost every aspect of the game, including the prestigious Milthon award for Best Mobile Game in Paris, and the IMGA (International Mobile Game Award) at the mobile world congress in Barcelona.GameplayEDGE is a platforming game with grid-based movement. You control a cube which must make it to the exit of each level while collecting smaller, colorful cubes called ""prisms"". Collecting prisms increases the movement speed of your cube. Scoring is based on the time to complete an individual level as well as the percentage of prisms collected. Like many other games, EDGE makes use of an S-Rank if you perform flawlessly in a level.Final releases of the game came with over 40 levels, as well as unlockable levels upon collecting all the cubes in each of the main levels. Some of the levels imitate light themes from classic games, or make use of optical illusions to twist the players perception (as the camera is isometric and not directly controlled by the player). There are no enemies in the game but levels commonly include dynamic elements such as buttons, moving tiles or obstacles which may cause an unwary player to fall off the edge of the level. Doing so results in a restart from various invisible check points. Time continues during and after death, making a perfect playthrough the best way to complete a level for S-Rank. There are also more advanced techniques such as balancing the cube halfway to 'hang' on an edge, or using special tiles to shrink your cube and allow it to climb vertical surfaces or fit through smaller areas.You control the cube on the iPhone by swiping and holding your finger in the direction you want it to move, anywhere on the screen. EDGE was the very first game on the App Store to implement this type of touch control. The PC version can be controlled with a keyboard or controller, which can cause confusion as the cube moves diagonally relative to the keys pressed.ControversyLegal IssuesOn April 7th, 2009, the founder of Mobigame, David Papazian, received an email from Apple stating that his game had been reported as infringing on a copyright for the word ""Edge"", and that it would be removed from the App Store. Soon after, he send the owner of the trademark for ""EDGE"", Tim Langdel an email, hoping to work out the issue personally. The following are excerpts of the two initial emails, quoted from an in-depth article posted by Eurogamer on August 3, 2009.""We chose the name Edge because it reflects the game's style: the cube you navigate through levels is always hanging on the edge. I did not know about your company or your games before. Please believe me that we did not intend to pass our game off as one of yours in any way.""Tim Langdel replied with the following:""I am a strong supporter of innovation in games... It is not our intention to do anything other than encourage originality in games and to encourage new game makers. But the problem is that using the trademark 'EDGE' for a game is a direct infringement of our international rights. We have spent a lot of time (and a large amount of money) stopping everyone who tries to use the mark EDGE [for a] game. You wouldn't think of using 'Activision' as the name of a game would you? Even though there has never been a game called Activision. Or 'Electronic Arts' or 'Nintendo'? No, all these names are so closely associated with the name of the company, you would not be permitted to use them for a game without the express permission of the trademark owner... It is the same with EDGE.""These emails sparked what has become one of the most publicized legal battles involving an independent game developer in recent history. On one side of the fence, Langdell claims that he has full rights to using the word ""EDGE"" in any game setting, and that the game itself is very similar to his 1986 title ""Bobby Bearing"". He stated that he offered that Mobigame simply change the name to ""EDGY"", but registered the US trademark for ""EDGY"" soon after making the suggestion.According to David, he had tried to work with Tim through multiple emails, but essentially was unable to reach an agreement on the trademark infringement. Both parties have reported conflicting stories as to what actually took place, and evidence supporting both sides has gone public in various forms; generally email communications.Public OpinionWhile the legal battle between Mobigame and Edge Games has been going for quite some time, no verdict has been reached on the matter. However, public opinion on the matter has been overwhelmingly on the side of David Papazian. This could be due to Mobigame being the ""underdog"" in this matter; the independent studio going up against an established company. However, several popular gaming news sites who reported on the events, such as Kotaku and Eurogamer, mentioned numerous cases in the past where Langdell had aggressively sought out legal action against other developers who tried to use the word ""edge"" in their game title or other platforms. This includes major publisher Namco, who was planning on releasing their game, Soul Edge, in the US at the time. Namco ended up changing the name of the game to ""Soul Blade"" in the US to avoid complications.Multiple Apps Store ReleasesDuring the period of legal actions from and against Mobigame, EDGE has been released and removed several times on the App Store. The game was released in December, 2008, but was pulled several months later in May 2009 after Apple received the warning about the copyright violations. After no settlement was made between Mobigame and Edge Games, EDGE was approved by Apple and returned to the app store on October 7, 2009 as ""Edge by Mobigame"". Despite the change in name, the game was pulled again just a few weeks later on November 26th.Mobigame then released the game a 3rd time under the name ""EDGY"" a few days later on December 1. Soon after, it was pulled again, this time by Mobigame, who was worried the release would be used in Langdell's case against EA. Currently, EDGE/EDGY cannot be found in the US or UK App stores, but is still available in other countries. The only game currently available by Mobigame in the US and UK is Cross Fingers.EA's InvolvementIn September of 2009, Electronic Arts Entertainment filed a Petition for Cancellation against several ""Edge"" trademarks. EA states that the word ""Edge"" has not actively been used in any recent commerce from the company. This came a few months after Langdell had threatened legal action against EA for using the same word in their ""Mirror's Edge"" series of games.As of March, 2010, reports from Edge Games, Langdell's game company, state that they are ""completely confident"" they will win the legal battles with both Mobigame and EA. Below is an excerpt from a press release by Edge Games concerning the matter:""Bottom line, we are the oldest remaining British game company, and one of the oldest remaining US game companies doesn't like the fact there is still one UK company older than itself that they have not yet destroyed. And they wont succeed. False rumours, misinformation and defamation never won any trademark case and it wont this time, either.IGDA InvolvementTim Langdell was inducted onto the board at the International Game Developers Association in March of 2009. After the events and accusations of Langdell's alleged involvement in ""trademark trolling"" smaller independent developers, including Mobigame, an internal petition to members of the IGDA called for a vote to remove him. While the IGDA did not directly start the petition, a meeting was called for October, 3, 2009 to consider the action. Tim resigned from the board in August, 2009.ResolutionOn April 17th, 2013, the legal battle finally reached a conclusion when a California judge formally cancelled Langdell's ownership of the trademark after all legal hurdles in the way of EA's petition for cancellation originally filed in 2009 had been cleared.System RequirementsPC RequirementsMinimum:OS:Windows XPProcessor:Intel Pentium 4 / AMD Athlon XP 1.5 Ghz or higherMemory:512 MB RAMGraphics:DirectX 9 compatible, 64MB VRAMDirectXÂ®:dx90cHard Drive:100 MB HD spaceRecommended:Memory:1 GB RAMDirectXÂ®:dx90cMac RequirementsMinimum:OS:OS X 10.5 (Leopard)Processor:IntelMemory:512 MB RAMHard Drive:100 MB HD spaceRecommended:Memory:1 GB RAM",,,,,,,,,

In the core game, the player travels across platforming locations broken into fragments, with the fragments often solidifying into platforms when approached in order to facilitate progress.The balletic protagonist's grace is demonstrated through her traversal and the way she animates when crossing over narrow bridges or fighting enemies. She regularly runs afoul of an evil monarch that has dropped her kingdom into its current chaotic state. The framing story, meanwhile, presents a pregnant woman who is returning to a beach and reminiscing about her childhood. These memories are first represented by the levels and then by a vivid static image that the player must recreate by corralling broken fragments together. These snippets eventually reveal the tale of the woman's unhappy upbringing and her hang-ups about her parents.",,,,,,,,,

The player takes the role of various runaway teenagers attempting to hitchhike to Petria's northern border to escape a tyrannical regime during a pivotal presidential election cycle. Along the way, they'll meet various characters who are connected to a tragic incident that took place 10 years ago which made Petria into the authoritarian nation it currently is today.GameplayThe player takes control of various generic teenagers who are never seen during gameplay, but are procedurally generated through random variables such as age, gender, health, and money. As the player interacts with NPCâs in the story, they can also attain skills that can affect their interactions with other characters they can meet on their journey or help them out in various situations along the path.Each segment of gameplay is generated procedurally along a linear narrative that changes the amount of objects or NPCâs that the player can interact with, and which story scene will generate next in the storyline. Every choice or action the player takes will affect the outcome of one scene and potentially change the outcome of the story at the end.The objective for each segment in the storyline is to make it to the northern border of Petria without dying or being apprehended by law enforcement entities. Players can eat food items to get a short boost of health or rest at different locations along the route to get a long term restoration. Players can also use money to buy items or services from NPCâs such as music cassette tapes, food, or lodging.StoryIn 1986, a terrorist attack at the northern border of Petria claimed the lives of many people. This incident, which became known as The Collapse of '86, emboldened the already authoritarian government to intrude into the everyday lives of its citizens to ensure President Tyrak ruled forever with an iron fist. Now in a extremely contentious election cycle, many teens are choosing to leave home and start a new life in Petria's neighbor to the north rather than wait for the outcome of a potential victory for the incumbent President Tyrak.CharactersAlong the way are various characters with different occupations and political views concerning President Tyrak and the election, but are all connected to The Collapse of '86.",,,,,,,,,

1465650,Anno 1800 - City Lights Pack,499,Blue Byte,Ubisoft,0,0,0,"Simulation, Strategy","English, French, Italian, German, Spanish - Spain, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Russian, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese",,,"DescriptionAnno 1800 is the seventh main iteration of the city building simulation game, not counting spin-offs, developed by German studio Blue Byte. The game focuses primarily on workforces and the budding technological advancements of colonial times, from farming to factory work.As with previous installations in the series, the goal is to colonize a series of islands, meet the needs of a growing and more demanding population, while eventually expanding to other settlements. Every island has a certain amount of fertile grounds for specific products, which enables a trading mechanism. Fertility can differ on the starting map, called The Old World, and a second map, South America.There are three main segments in Anno 1800: A campaign, a sandbox mode and a multiplayer option that holds up to four players.CampaignAnno 1800 has a campaign that spans four chapters. The story revolves around a family business, where the death of the patriarch sets off a power struggle. The player protagonist is cast out in a family argument with their uncle, Edvard Goode. Players erect a competing business on a separate island and attempt to work off a funeral debt in the first chapter.WorkforceA primary gameplay element in Anno 1800 is the separate, specific workforces that each production building requires. There are five tiers in total:FarmersWorkersArtisansEngineersInvestorsThe tiers each originate from the Farmerâs Residence building and can be upgraded by meeting specific needs of stored products and a vicinity to services, like schools.Upgrading a tier removes the populace number from the previous tier. Workers do not perform Farmersâ duties and so on. This leads to having specific residences throughout the map, to service buildings of certain tiers.NewspaperAt certain intervals, a publisher will ask the player to print a newspaper that can affect the colonyâs happiness or needs. Three front page segments will affect the people in a positive or negative way. By using an influence score, the player can adjust one of the three articles, by replacing them with propaganda.AttractivenessAside from just meeting the needs of the people, Anno 1800 also balances an attractiveness system to get people to move in. There are positive and negative elements to attractiveness.Culture, Nature and Festivity contribute to a positive attractiveness score. Nature is the amount of open grounds and forests that are left on a certain island, while Festivity marks special events where the populace holds festivals and such. Culture can be built by placing ornaments or through the Zoo and Museum buildings, which can add more exhibition segments to their surroundings. The Zoo and Museum buildings are unlocked in the Artisan citizen tier.Vulgarity, Pollution and Instability lead to a negative attractiveness score. Vulgarity marks things like pig farms, while Pollution contains buildings like coal-powered factories. Instability scores are events like riots or epidemics that get triggered in settlements.ExpeditionsCertain expeditions chances can appear that require a boat from the playerâs fleet. Each expedition will have certain random events happen during it, which can be predicted beforehand in segments like Naval Power, Diplomacy, Hunting and so on. Boats can stock up on certain items to boost the effectiveness of these traits.Random events play out like choose-your-own-adventure games, where choices with certain success percentages are prompted. Losing these events will lower the boatâs morale, which can lead to failure.Returning from a successful expedition can yield special items, like Zoo and Museum exhibitions or building specialists.FactionsThe map has a set of different settlements with their own factions located on it. Some parties are more receptive than others, as some start with trading possibilities opened. For others, the player will need to engage in diplomacy to unlock trading rights or alliances. Factions can be influenced by flattery, offering gifts or performing quests, such as delivering certain goods or destroying enemy ships.Pirates can also be their own faction and will start as openly hostile to players, though they can also be persuaded through this diplomacy systemSystem RequirementsMINIMUM:Low Settings - 1080p | 30 FPS:OS: Windows 7 | 8 | 10 (64-bit only)CPU: Intel i5-2500K - 3.3 Ghz, AMD FX 6350 - 3.9 GhzRAM: 8 GBGPU: Nvidia GTX 660 - 2GB, AMD Radeon R7 260X - 2GBDIRECT X: DirectX 11 | 12Low Settings - 1080p | 60 FPS:OS: Windows 7 | 8 | 10 (64-bit only)CPU: Intel i5-4460 - 3.2 Ghz, AMD Ryzen3 1200 - 3.1 GhzRAM: 8 GBGPU: Nvidia GTX 670 - 2GB, AMD Radeon R9 270X - 2GBDIRECT X: DirectX 11 | 12RECOMMENDED:High Settings - 1080p | 30 FPS:OS: Windows 7 | 8 | 10 (64-bit only)CPU: Intel i5-4690K - 3.5 Ghz, AMD Ryzen5 1400 - 3.2 GhzRAM: 8 GBGPU: Nvidia GeForce GTX 770 - 4GB, AMD Radeon R9 285 - 2GBDIRECT X: DirectX 11 | 12High Settings - 1080p | 60 FPS:OS: Windows 7 | 8 | 10 (64-bit only)CPU: Intel i5-4690k - 3.5 Ghz, AMD Ryzen5 1500X - 3.5 GhzRAM: 8 GBGPU: Nvidia GeForce GTX 970 - 4GB, AMD Radeon R9 290X - 4GBDIRECT X: DirectX 11 | 12",,,,,,,,,

It also received a retail release in Europe sometime after.A spin-off of the Euro Truck Simulator series, and the sibling to Euro Truck Simulator 2, American Truck Simulator brings the series' driving simulation and trucking company management to the United States of America (which was previously the setting to the studio's earlier 18 Wheels of Steel series). Much of the gameplay and interface remain the same, as players can customize the game's simulation aspects, purchase and customize their own trucks and trucking business, and improve their reputation to receive better-paying deliveries.The game was originally released with the West Coast state of California as the sole locale (with Nevada as free day-one DLC) and two trucks (the Kenworth T680 and the Peterbilt 579). Additional states, as well as additional cargo types and truck accessories, were periodically added as expansions and DLC for sale. Similar to Euro Truck Simulator 2, the game has received numerous post-release updates, including revamped locales, additional truck models, gameplay improvements, and updates to the user interface.TrucksFreightliner Cascadia  International LT International LoneStar  Kenworth T 680Kenworth W900  Mack Anthem   Peterbilt 389Peterbilt 579 Volvo VNL  Western Star 49X Kenworth:Kenworth T 680Kenworth W900Peterbilt:Peterbilt 579Peterbilt 389Volvo:Volvo VNLInternational:International LoneStar International LTMack:Mack AnthemWestern StarWestern Star 49XMap RescaleWhen SCS started development on American Truck simulator, there was a small team of 4 people working on it.

The game was developed by UK-based developer, Blitz Game Studios.Each of these games was $4.00 with the purchase of any combo. Each of the Burger King games only had achievements worth 200 points.Cross-CompatibilityThe three promotional games were notable for being the first three games to have cross-compatibility between the original Xbox and the Xbox 360. The same disc could be used on either system. The games were the same on both systems; however, playing on the original Xbox resulted in lower texture resolution and lower polygon count.GameplayThe game has the player assume the role of The Burger King himself as he attempts to sneak up on unsuspecting victims and provide them with Burger King products. The products range from the almighty Whopper to Burger King-branded fries and coffee.Stealth is the primary focus of the game. In order to feed the various construction workers and citizens that inhabit Sneak King's world, players must sneak up on them. Each character that players are able to feed has a blue shadow that appears around their vicinity; if the player happens to tip-toe into it, the character will be alerted. While avoiding the blue shadow, players must get close enough to the characters to surprise them. Once they are surprised, players then can attempt to perform a flourish maneuver by hitting 'A' at the appropriate time. There are three levels of flourish, one being the worst and three being the best; the better the flourish, the more points that are awarded. Another way to obtain more points is by racking up chain surprises. To do this, one must simply surprise multiple targets without getting spotted. Surprising characters from a hiding spot, such as a dumpster or a bush, will award bonus points as well.LocationsThe game consists of four locations:SawmillCul-De-SacConstruction SiteDowntownXbox 360 Game InstallationInstallation to the Xbox 360 HDD is not supported at this time.",,,,,,,,,

A world war between these powers had left the world's economy in shambles. After the war, to boost each other's economies, the world powers approved for the city-state of Valhalla to be founded on the tripoint of the three nations. Valhalla functions as a politically neutral commerce hub, allowing the world powers to freely conduct trade without having to worry about their political relations.The massive amount of goods passing through Valhalla caught the interest of criminal organisations, and soon the city was riddled with crime. With its police department outgunned, Valhalla goverment, who as a neutral state were forbidden from maintaining an army, implemented the Troubleshooter program.The Troubleshooter program allows for licensed Troubleshooters to aid in the investigation and arresting of criminals. Being independent contractors, Troubleshooters were expected to be a highly cost-effective way to combat the increasing crime rate.Story premiseAlbus Bernstein, orphaned by a mysterious disaster that occurred 10 years prior to the game's events, decides to start his own Troubleshooter company. By growing successful as a Troubleshooter he hopes to attain a security clearance high enough to access the classified files on the disaster that killed his parents. GameplayMissionsThroughout the game, several types of missions will be available for selection from the Mission Control Board. In addition, roster members and story-related NPCs will occasionally make requests that result in a mission happening.Missions have different objectives, such as defeating all enemies, defeating a specific target, rescuing civilians, collecting certain items, or reaching a certain area.Missions may contain story or dialogue choices that affect the way the mission plays out.Types of missionScenario case: Missions which will advance the story of the game.Ordinary case: Optional missions which can be infinitely replayed. These do not advance the story but often contain some story content to flesh out the game world.Violent case: Optional missions larger in scale than ordinary cases and which involves more epic grade units and boss units.Requested case: Between missions, you may accept personal requests from NPCs, which will appear as optional objectives in regular missions.CombatCombat takes place on square grid-based maps viewed from a top down perspective. Units take turns to act and are given 2 action points to spend on movement, combat abilities, support abilities, or item abilities.Turn order is determined by each unit's action time. Action time is based on a unit's speed stat, combined with the cast delay of their actions in their previous turn. Units are able to influence the turn order by increasing or decreasing their (or other units') action time through various active and passive abilities.When attacking an enemy unit, hit chance and damage are calculated based on both units' stats and abilites, as well as environmental factors and present cover. Defending units may block an incoming hit for reduced damage, attacking units may score a critical hit for bonus damage.Sometimes, attack abilities will interact with environmental factors to produce a 'chain effect'. Units pushed back into a wall will be stunned by the collision, units that are flashbanged in pitch black rooms will be left unable to tell friend from foe, etc.By defeating enemies, units earn experience points, which will increase their overall level as well as their class-specific level. Bonus experience points can be earned through one-hit KO-ing or overkilling an enemy unit. A portion of a unit's earned experience will be shared with its allies. Unit customisationClassesEach unit will have their own class which will determine their stats, ability slots and mastery slots. By levelling up a class, class-specific masteries and new abilities may be unlocked. Characters may freely swap between their unlocked classes and (unlike class-specific masteries) abilities that are unlocked by playing one class may be equipped by the character regardless of their currently selected class.MasteriesEach unit has their own mastery board, upon which masteries can be equipped. Mastery effects range from simple stat bonuses (e.g. '+5% hit chance'), to more complex effects (e.g. 'when hit by an enemy unit, move 2 tiles towards said unit and increase your attack power by 50% until your next attack for a maximum of 4 stacks') and can even add new abilities to a unit.Masteries can be earned through battle or by researching them. By equipping certain masteries on the same unit at the same time, hidden mastery sets may be unlocked which will grant additional effects.AbilitiesEach unit will have access to their own unique attack and support abilities. Through levelling up each class available to a unit, additional abilities will be unlocked. A character's ability slots are limited, however, so choices have to be made about which abilities to equip.EquipmentCharacters will be equipped with weapons, armour, and tools such as potions or gadgets. This equipment can be earned through battle, bought from a shop, or crafted from a workbench. At a workbench, equipment may also be upgraded or broken down into materials.Besides rarity, weapons and armour will also have a quality grade. The effects of the quality grade are partially randomised so that even weapons and armour of the same type, rarity, and quality grade may offer different stat bonuses.    ",,,,,,,,,

It was later ported by Fun Labs for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 on December 15, 2015.The tenth main installment of the Tony Hawk series, Pro Skater 5 aimed to bring the series back to its earlier ""Pro Skater"" roots by omitting a story-based campaign and certain gameplay mechanics (such as dismounting from the skateboard). Similar to Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4, players navigate each level in a ""Free Skate"" fashion and earn experience points and rewards by completing missions scattered throughout. It uses an updated version of the game engine used in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater HD.Like previous games in the series, Pro Skater 5 includes special guest characters. For this entry, King Graham (from King's Quest) and rapper Lil Wayne are included (with fellow rapper Tyler, the Creator and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles added post-release). Characters from other games are also available as character customization options, including Octodad (from Octodad: Dadliest Catch).It is the last game in the series to be published by Activision (as their licensing deal expired shortly after release). The game was known for being rushed into completion (likely due to the licensing deal expiration), with the game being mostly unplayable without a large day-one patch. It is also the last game from Robomodo.SkatersTony HawkRiley HawkNyjah Huston (new to the series)Leticia Bufoni (new to the series)Aaron âJawsâ Homoki (new to the series)Ishod Wair (new to the series)David GonzalezLizzie Armanto (new to the series)Chris ColeAndrew ReynoldsKing Graham (unlockable, guest character from King's Quest)Lil' Wayne (guest character)Tyler, the Creator (added post-release, guest character)Leonardo / Donatello / Michelangelo / Raphael (added post-release, guest characters from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)LevelsThe BerricsBonfire BeachSchool IIIMega ParkRooftopsThe BunkerAsteroid BeltMountain (added post-release)Wild West (added post-release)The Underground (added post-release)SoundtrackAnti-Flag - ""Stars and Stripes""Atmosphere - ""Southsiders""Black Pistol Fire - ""Hipster Shakes""Bully - ""Milkman""Cloud Nothings - ""I'm Not Part of Me""Cold Cave - ""A Little Death to Laugh""Connie Price and the Keystones - ""International Hustler""Crass Mammoth - ""All 149""Deaf Poets - ""Degenerate Mind""Death - ""Keep on Knocking""Death From Above 1979 - ""Virgins""Deer Mother - ""When the Wolves Come Out""Doomtree - ""Minibrute""Fake P - ""Rorschach""Family Force 5 - ""Raised by Wolves""Four Year Strong - ""Go Down in History""Harlan - ""Moment to Myself""Hundred Visions - ""Our Ritual""Hungry Hands - ""Highline""Icons for Hire - ""Cynics and Critics""Killer Be Killed - ""Wings of Feather and Wax""New Politics - ""Everywhere I Go""Plague Vender - ""Black Sap Scriptures""Ratatat - ""Cream on Chrome""Rattblack - ""Skate Rock""Royal Blood - ""Little Monster""State Champs - ""Secrets""Temples - ""Shelter Song""The Orwells - ""Who Needs You""The Schitzophonics - ""Rat Trap""The Sheds - ""Bad Things are Bad""Yogi & Skrillex - ""Burial""",,,,,,,,,

It was announced at E3 2010, and was released on March 13, 2012. Much like their previous two titles, it aims to be more of an unusual, experimental experience rather than a traditional game and is meant to evoke strong emotions from the player. It is the final game in a three-game deal that thatgamecompany signed with Sony, and was part of the Spring Fever promotion on PSN. On March 29, 2012, Jenova Chen announced, on his blog, that Journey had become the fastest selling game ever released in the SCEA region on the PlayStation Network. On July 21, 2015, Journey was re-released on the Playstation 4 and was cross-buy with the Playstation 3 digital version.StoryJourney has an ambiguous story that takes place in a ravaged landscape dotted with ruins. When the player begins a new journey, their character is sitting in a desert, with no backstory, name, or apparent purpose besides reaching the glowing mountain in the distance.During Journey, the player will come upon two direct forms of storytelling. The first form they will encounter is glyphs, mosaic stonework that reveals some of the history of the area. The second form comes in between level visions. In these cutscenes a large white-robed figure shares, in pictographic vignettes, the past, present, and future of the player. The following is a literal interpretation, although many figurative interpretations are no less valid.The world of Journey wasn't always in ruins. A white-robed culture once thrived here, at first living with nature and soon, with the help of the same power that allows the player's character to fly, overwhelming nature with structures, building higher and higher.When this power dwindled, the culture split into warring tribes, building mechanical insectoid war machines rather than buildings. The war killed many, explaining the graves littering the landscape as the player progresses.In its wake, the war left the ruined cities the player sees and the still functioning machines that impede their path.Not all of this white-robed culture died, though. A final glyph reveals that the remaining few went back to the mountain from whence they came.The player, meanwhile, is part of an endless cycles of many players journeying to and flying back from the mountain, a progression that makes some players act as newcomers, slowly finding their way, while others become mentors and guides having already found it.GameplayLooks like we're in for a long trip.Journey is a third-person adventure game where players play as a mysterious robed being who embarks on a journey to a mountain that emanates light from its peak.The player has three distinct modes of interaction. First, they can chirp or shout. By pressing or pressing and holding the circle button, the player creates a bubble of influence and a tone specific to that journeyer. This tone allows the player to communicate with another journeyer. If one journeyer shouts near another, the shout will replenish the other player's jumping ability. Also, shouts can refresh old cloth and scarves throughout the game, giving life to the sentient cloth.Second, they can fly. In Journey, players can jump and glide through the air, but only as long as their scarf will let them, as it designates how long one can stay airborne. When the player's scarf is lit and its symbols are showing, the player can press or hold the cross button to fly. The scarf can be lengthened, and thus strengthened, by collecting glowing symbols hidden throughout the environments. Besides interaction with other players, the scarf can be replenished through refreshed cloth, that which is also glowing and showing its symbols, and, later, through a mystic, water-like aura. This fact allows players to climb vertically indefinitely until the cloth or aura ends.Third, they can run or slide. Basic movement on the left analog stick makes the character run. Desert sand can slow the player on an uphill, or quicken them on the downhill. Certain sections of the game revolve around continuous sliding downhill, while feels like a snowboarding game.Journey tasks the player with solving puzzles to move on to the the next area. Environments are open, but strong winds keep players on the right track. Most puzzles involve freeing old cloth so that it opens up the path for the player. Players are also tasked with avoiding enemies with visible spotlights, as being caught in the light will fling the player and damage their scarf.MultiplayerWork together... or don't.Journey is considered unique when it comes to multiplayer, as it doesn't ask players if they want to play with others. It forces co-op onto the player by making them meet with other players at random. The game sees what level the player is on and inserts another player who's on the same level into their game. When another player enters, a white light will appear on the sides of the screen to lead the player to that other person if they want to join them. The only way not to play with others is to log off PSN while playing.Players can work together by giving each other boosts of power, huddle together for warmth, or simply guide one another across the vast landscape. There is no way to hinder other players.Players can only encounter others after the first area of the game, which becomes a level select hub after completion. Players can stay with each other throughout the entire journey if they wish. Doing so requires entering between level loads with that partner.During the journey, the player will usually be unaware of who they are playing with. It is possible to play with friends if both enter the same area at the same time, but this involves out-of-game communication. Within the game, players only learn the PSN IDs of their companions after the credits, when the PSN IDs appear in chronological order. Players can only communicate by using the circle button to emit sounds. The longer the button is held down, the louder the note will be.References to Past thatgamecompany GamesflOwOne of the cellular lifeforms from flOw can be found hidden in the temple in the sixth level. Finding the life form unlocks the trophy Ancestors.FlowerA flower can be found in between two sand dunes in the third level. Finding the flower unlocks the trophy Mirage.New Game+When the player completes their first journey, more embroidery appears on their robe. The more journeys the player takes, the more covered their robe becomes.The first area becomes a chapter select and bonus tracking hub. The player can go to any of the 7 levels by entering the shrines for each. In each shrine are the glyphs or empty frames where they would be, depending on whether the player has found them. Also in the hub is an open-air ruin that records all the scarf-lengthening symbols the player has found.Additionally, while the player's scarf does not retain its length between playthroughs, if the player collects every symbol, they unlock a circle of white, vertical scarves behind the area that records symbol collection. If the player enters this circle, their robe goes from red to white. White-robed players' scarves refill with power whenever they are on the ground, making their flying ability essentially unlimited. Players can reenter the circle to return to the red robe.ReceptionJourney has achieved both commercial and critical success. It currently holds the record as the fastest selling game ever released on PlayStation store. Journey has received universal acclaim, with a score of 92/100 on Metacritic.Journey was nominated for 11 D.I.C.E. Awards, and won in the following eight categories:Game of the YearOutstanding Achievement in Game Direction (Jenova Chen)Outstanding Achievement in Art DirectionOutstanding Achievement in Online GameplayOutstanding Innovation in GamingCasual Game of the YearOutstanding Achievement in Sound DesignOutstanding Achievement in Original Music CompositionJourney SoundtrackThe music was composed by Austin Wintory, He also did the soundtrack for another thatgamecompany game called flOw1.

It aims to recapture the magic of the SNES-era RPGs and borrows a lot from Chrono Trigger in particular in both its graphical style and battle system. The game was originally planned for Game Boy Advance and was still known as Project Exile during this time; however, as the game was nearing completion in 2006, the GBA was on its way out, and development was shifted to the DS.GameplayBattle SystemBlack Sigil's battle system borrows a lot from Chrono Trigger's ""Active Time Battle 2.0"" battle system, but builds upon it as well. The developers have dubbed Black Sigil's battle system ""Active-Time Tactical Combat"" due to its incorporation of elements from tactical turn-based games. While most traditional RPGs don't take party positioning into account, Black Sigil does, and the player is even able to move their characters around manually so they can line up their attacks just right. This something that wasn't possible in Chrono Trigger, and the player simply had to wait till the enemies moved into the right position if they wanted to get the most out of their area attacks.",,,,,,,,,

1464130,Archons of Doom,1199,Third Impression,Third Impression,0,0,0,Strategy,English,,,"OverviewDoom (not to be confused with the original 1993 game of the same name) is a sci-fi horror first-person shooter developed by id and published by Bethesda for the Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and PC on May 13, 2016. It was later ported by Panic Button to the Nintendo Switch (without SnapMap functionality) on November 10, 2017.The fourth mainline title in the franchise of the same name and its second reboot, Doom harkens back to the fast-paced philosophy of early Doom and Quake installments (avoiding the slower survival-horror mechanics of Doom 3). Along with a full-fledged single-player campaign (with upgradable gear), the game features standard loadout-based multiplayer (co-developed by Certain Affinity) and a detailed level creation system (which is called ""SnapMap"" and is co-developed by Escalation).Set on a Union Aerospace Corporation (UAC) research facility on a futuristic Mars overrun by the forces of Hell, the main campaign puts the player in the role of the mysterious silent protagonist known as the Doom Slayer. Awakened from a mysterious sarcophagus and armored with his high-tech Praetor Suit, the Doom Slayer must fight hordes of demons and possessed humans throughout the facility while learning of the events that's transpired (involving the harvesting of Hellish ""Argent"" energy) and preventing a larger rift between the two realms.It is the first game to run on their proprietary id Tech 6 engine and had had a long nine-year development cycle (including an original concept as a cinematic game detailing a Hell invasion of Earth). Months prior to the game's release, the multiplayer portion received both closed and open beta testing periods. Post-release, the game has received numerous updates (including new gameplay options, new game modes, and SnapMap improvements) and multiplayer content packs by Bethesda Austin (along with a season pass, with all content later made available to all in July 2017).The game later received a VR-focused spin-off (Doom VFR) on November 30, 2017 and a full-fledged sequel (Doom Eternal) on March 20, 2020.Gameplay CampaignMissionsRip & Tear (The UAC)Know Your Enemy (Resource Operations)Meltdown (Foundry)Beginning of the End (Argent Facility)Argent Tower (Argent Energy Tower)Into the Fire (Kadingir Sanctum)Hell on Mars (Argent Facility Destroyed)A Brighter Tomorrow (Advanced Research Complex)Lazarus (Lazarus Labs)Titan's Realm (Titan's Realm)The Crucible (Necropolis)I Am VEGA (VEGA Central Processing)The Well (Argent D'Nur)WeaponsPistol - Rechargable semi-automatic energy pistol that has infinite ammo and is given at the very start of the game. It is automatically modded with the Charged Energy Shot (which allows players to charge up and fire a more-powerful shot).Combat Shotgun (Shells) - Standard pump-action shotgun for close-range combat. Players can mod it with either the Charged Burst (which allows players to charge up and fire a volley of three shells in quick succession) or the Explosive Shot (which allows players to launch mortar shotshells).Plasma Rifle (Cells) - Fully automatic energy rifle that fires pulses of plasma capable of dealing minor splash damage. Players can mod it with either the Heat Blast (which allows players to release a damaging blast of excess heat, which is recharged by regular firing) or the Stun Bomb (which allows players to launch plasma orbs that detonates and stuns enemies).Heavy Assault Rifle (Bullets) - Fully automatic assault rifle for ranged combat. Players can mod it with either the Tactical Scope (which allows players to zoom in at longer ranges) or the Micro Missiles (which allows players to launch small missiles).Rocket Launcher (Rockets) - Standard rocket-propelled grenade launcher that fires rockets at a straight path, dealing explosive damage over a large radius. Players can mod it with either the Remote Detonation (which allows players to detonate their rockets mid-flight) or the Lock-on Burst (which allow players to lock-in to a target and fire a volley of three rockets in a quick succession).Super Shotgun (Shells) - Old-fashioned double-barreled shotgun that deals powerful close-ranged damage (at the cost of requiring a reload after shooting). Although the weapon cannot be modded, players can still upgrade it with faster reloading, improved shot penetration, and single-shell firing.Gauss Cannon (Cells) - A large and powerful railgun that fires flechettes at a high velocity. Players can mod it with either the Precision Bolt (which allows players to zoom in at longer ranges while charging up high-damage shots) or the Siege Mode (which allows players to remain stationary to charge up a powerful beam that overpenetrates targets).Chaingun (Bullets) - Rotary machine gun with a rate-of-fire that gets faster as the gun spins up. Players can mod it with either the Gatling Rotator (which allows players to spin up the barrels without firing) or the Mobile Turret (which allows players to ""unfold"" the barrels into three smaller gatling guns that do not need to spun beforehand, reduces movement speed, and can overheat).Chainsaw (Fuel) - An old-fashioned chainsaw. Unlike the Chainsaw in previous Doom games, it does not need to be continuously ""fired"", and is instead used to trigger a special glory-kill animation (without needing to stun the enemy first). Tougher enemies require more ""Fuel"" for the animation to take effect. Enemies who die from Chainsaw Glory Kills drop massive amounts of ammunition for other weapons. Players can neither mod nor upgrade it, and it is not accessible through the weapon wheel (instead being toggled with a dedicated button).BFG (Argent) - Massive energy weapon that charges for a short time before firing a large ball of energy that vaporizes everything in its short blast radius (while dealing damage to those nearby the projectile). Players can neither mod nor upgrade it, and it is not accessible through the weapon wheel (instead being toggled with a dedicated button). MultiplayerThe game's central multiplayer component pits up to 12 players in team-based combat (although free-for-all modes were added post-launch). Unlike multiplayer modes in past id games, Doom's main multiplayer mode takes its cue from popular first-person shooters in the past decade and implements both weapon loadouts (where players choose their two pre-determined weapons and one piece of equipment, all of which cannot be swapped out while alive), persistent leveling (where players unlock weapons, gear, and cosmetic options for both armor and weapons), and online matchmaking (with pre-determined playlists and lobby voting).It also ties in to the in-game lore by having all players as soldiers participating in UAC's virtual reality battle simulator (announced by the VEGA artifical intelligence). Throughout the match, VEGA announces and spawns limited-use power weapons (including the Chainsaw and BFG) and power-ups (including one that transforms the player into their preferred demon type as a player-controlled ""boss character"").Players can also participate in traditional deathmatch and co-operative multiplayer using the alternate SnapMap mode. All weapons and armor cosmetics in the main multiplayer mode is also available in SnapMap.Game ModesTeam Deathmatch - Standard team-based deathmatch. Players earn points for their team by eliminating enemy combatants.Soul Harvest - Similar to the Kill Confirmed game mode in the Call of Duty series, Soul Harvest is Team Deathmatch with a twist: players drop a ""soul"" when they die. Players can only earn points for their team by collecting enemy souls.Clan Arena - Standard round-based last team standing. Players cannot respawn after being eliminated. Each round ends after either the timer expires or one team is eliminated (which grants the other team a single point).Freeze Tag - Clan Arena with a twist: when combatants are eliminated, they are flash-frozen. Players can ""thaw"" their teammates by staying nearby them for a short amount of time, which lets them respawn. Players can also push frozen enemies using their weaponry, although knocking an enemy player into insta-kill areas thaws them.Domination - Standard king of the hill. Teams fight for possession of three zones scattered throughout the battlefield (which can be captured by standing in the zone uncontested for a short amount of time). Teams earn points over time for each zone in their possession.Warpath - Domination with a twist: there is only one zone, which roams through a pre-determined path throughout the battlefield.Exodus (added on July 29, 2016) - Neutral-flag capture-the-flag. Teams fight over possession of a single flag, and attempt to carry it to their roaming capture zone (which moves down a path in a similar fashion to the zone in Warpath).Sector (added on July 29, 2016) - An objective-based mode (loosely similar to Extraction in Halo 4) where players must secure zones scattered throughout the map (in a similar fashion to Domination and Warpath) and defend them from enemy contention. After 15 seconds of being uncontested, the zone is captured, the occupied team gains one point, and the zone moves to another random location.Deathmatch (added on September 22, 2016) - Standard free-for-all deathmatch. Players earn points by eliminating enemy combatants.Bloodrush (added on October 19, 2016) - Free-for-all round-based last man standing with limited spawns. Each player has a ""respawn energy bar"" which slowly drains and is replenished in-part by killing enemy combatants. When a player dies with their energy fully depleted, they are eliminated and cannot respawn for that round. Players gain points at the end of each round based on how many players were eliminated before them. Each round ends after either the timer expires or only one player remains.Possession (added on October 19, 2016) - Similar to the Infection/Flood modes in the Halo series, Possession is a round-based survival mode where all players start off in the same team (the Humans). One or more players are then ""possessed"" and are swapped to the other team (the Possessed). Players on the Possessed team always have the Demon Rune in effect (limited to the Prowler type). Players gain points as Humans by killing Possessed players and surviving, while players gain points as Possessed by killing Human players (who are then swapped to the Possessed team). Each round ends after either the timer expires or there are no Human players remaining.Infernal Run (added on December 7, 2016) - Similar to the Ricochet mode in Halo 4, Infernal Run is an objective-based mode where teams fight over possession of a ""ball"" (a large demonic eyeball) and attempt to throw or carry the ball to the enemy goal. When the ball reaches a team's goal, the other team gains a point and all players reset back to their starting positions. Players in possession of the ball cannot use their weapons (and can discard it by either throwing it or passing it to a teammate). The game includes two rounds (or ""halves""), with the second half swapping the goal and player positions of both teams.MapsArgent Breach (formerly part of the Hell Followed content pack)BeneathBoneyard (formerly part of the Bloodfall content pack)Cataclysm (formerly part of the Unto the Evil content pack)ChasmDisposalEmpyrian (formerly part of the Bloodfall content pack)ExcavationHeatwaveHelixInfernalMolten (formerly part of the Hell Followed content pack)Offering (formerly part of the Unto the Evil content pack)Orbital (formerly part of the Hell Followed content pack)Outbreak (formerly part of the Bloodfall content pack)PerditionRitual (formerly part of the Unto the Evil content pack)SacrilegiousLoadoutsPlayers can customize the colors, materials, and patterns of different parts of their weapons.Each player loadout includes two weapon slots and an equipment slot, none of which can be empty. Players can unlock up to five custom loadouts (on top of three preset loadouts) and can switch between them in-game before respawning.Unlike other modes, players can no longer carry all weapons they pick up. They instead start with the weapons equipped in their two weapon slots (similar to most games at the time, most notably the Call of Duty series) at full ammunition, and can switch between them using the Weapon Switch button.Default presets (as of Update 6.66) are Assault (Rocket Launcher, Plasma Rifle, Frag Grenade), Sniper (Vortex Rifle, Super Shotgun, Personal Teleporter), and Ambusher (Heavy Assault Rifle, Grenade Launcher, Threat Pulse).WeaponsHeavy Assault Rifle - Fully automatic assault rifle (with headshots dealing critical damage).

Holding down Secondary Fire aims down the rifle's scope for extended range while charging the next shot for extra damage.Lightning Gun - Energy weapon that fires a constant stream of electricity (with consecutive hits dealing critical damage). Holding down Secondary Fire shoots an a stream that damages multiple targets (at higher ammo consumption and lower damage output).Combat Shotgun - Pump-action shotgun (with critical damage dealt if all pellets hit the same target). Holding down the Secondary Fire button changes the firing mode to launch a mortar shotshell that explodes on impact (with direct impacts dealing critical damage), which must recharge prior to firing again.Chaingun - Rotary machine gun with a rate-of-fire that gets faster as the gun spins up (with close-ranged hits dealing critical damage). Holding down Secondary Fire spins up the barrels without firing.Burst Rifle - Battle rifle that fires in a three-round burst (with headshots dealing critical damage). Holding down Secondary Fire aims down the rifle's sights for extended range (at the cost of a limited HUD) while changing the firing mode to semi-automatic.Grenade Launcher - Standard launcher that fires grenades that detonate shortly after impact with a normal surface, dealing explosive damage over a large radius (with direct impacts on enemies detonating automatically and dealing critical damage).

Originally these were ""hack modules"": consumable items that were given via random post-match drops, similar to the ""Burn Card"" system in Titanfall. On Update 6.66, these were replaced with ""runes"", which are traditional perks that are unlocked when the player reaches certain player levels.RunesPlayers unlock upwards of three rune slots to fill in-between matches, and can switch between them before respawning.

1463450,Fallstreak: Requiem for my Homeland,499,Centicerise Productions,Centicerise Productions,0,0,0,"Adventure, Casual, Indie",English,,,"OverviewHomeland is one of the four titles for the Nintendo GameCube which officially has support for online gameplay without the use of LAN, distinctions which otherwise go to various Phantasy Star Online games entirely. Developed by Chunsoft and released exclusively in Japan, Homeland spans two discs. One is devoted entirely to single-player gameplay while the other is only for online multiplayer. Homeland's implementation of online gameplay is notable by GameCube standards since it doesn't inherently rely on developer-owned servers located elsewhere. Although such servers previously existed to match players together, in addition to that, players can host game sessions on their own GameCube consoles and directly connect to them via IP with a maximum server capacity of 35 players and one game master influencing proceedings. As such, it is therefore not an MMORPG in the conventional sense a la World of Warcraft, since the technology behind the game is meant to make many players the hosts of many smaller-scale games with only the hardware they already have, instead of the usual method of congregating numerous players across a few proprietary servers.",,,,,,,,,

These tools can be built by collecting resources from destroyed buildings found in the environments. Later in the game players will also have to fend off bugs and other creatures endangering Sari. All this is done by using laparoscopic devices in-game that resemble those used by surgeons in real life.The game will support a unique controller based developed by Pezy on real laparoscopic equipment but utilizing two Wii Remotes and Nunchuks that act like laparoscopic graspers and a base plate resembling two trocar sites. According to developer Grendel Games, this will âsubconsciously train [the player's] basic laparoscopic skills, such as depth perception, eye-hand coordination, inverse movements and bi-manual dexterity.â Alternatively, the analog sticks on the Wii U GamePad can be used to control the game, if one does not wish to purchase the special controller.Underground will release as a Wii U eShop title and cost between â¬20-30 and the controller is said to be offered at an affordable price point far below that of typical learning tool equivalents (normally valued at about â¬200).

It prominently features the band TM Network in its story, as the player is attempting to put on a rock concert on their behalf to help usher in world peace.Like many Japanese adventure games of the era, the player is given a small amount of freedom to investigate their surroundings and talk to NPCs. One they've completed the requirements, the story moves ahead and they're taken to a new part of the game.StoryThe story starts on New Year's Eve in the year 1999. The player is enjoying the morning lounging around in his room generally doing nothing. After turning on his computer, he suddenly acquires information that the strategic defense satellite ""Colosseum"" has picked up some nuclear weapons being fired. These nuclear weapons are being fired at a rapid pace between two forces (presumably the USA and USSR). Without knowing it, World War III is breaking out in front of the player. A nuclear blast mysteriously sends the player back in time to December 22, 1989. The nuclear war will not be prevented and civilization will destroy itself unless the player can manage to get the Japanese rock band TM Network to a concert for world peace even if he has to drive a truck to get them to their destination.GameplayUsing his musical influence inspired by rock music, the player must persuade the world to declare global peace so that the nuclear war never happens. Using an interface that is utilized in visual novels and point & click adventures, the player interacts with the various members of the all-male rock band and various strangers. These people include the security guard, the office lady, and normal citizens of Japan. While some action components exist in the game, TM Network: Live in Power Bowl is mostly an adventure in the vein of the classic time travel stories. However, the player must watch how much information they let out. If he tells the wrong person that he is from 1999, then the game ends with him going to prison and the world is destroyed is eventually destroyed due to World War III. The game also includes a maze using 3D graphics and mini-games such as car chases. ",,,,,,,,,

1462650,LAST EMBRYO -EITHER OF BRAVE TO STORY-,1299,Kujiraboã,OTAKU Plan,0,0,1,"Adventure, Indie, RPG","English, Japanese, Simplified Chinese",,,"OverviewThe Last Story is a Wii-exclusive RPG from Final Fantasy's creator.The Last Story is an RPG from Hironobu Sakaguchi's studio Mistwalker made exclusively for the Wii. The game's soundtrack was composed by fellow Final Fantasy veteran and former Square Enix employee Nobuo Uematsu. Originally released in 2011 in Japan and published by Nintendo, the game was published in Europe a year later again by Nintendo on February 24, 2012. For a North American release, Nintendo partnered with XSEED Games to bring the game over on July 10, 2012--with the European localization as their basis. XSEED is owned by Marvelous AQL, a company formed from the mergers of Marvelous Entertainment, AQ Interactive, and Liveware. AQ Interactive also owned Artoon, the development house that co-developed The Last Story with Mistwalker. It went on to become XSEED's most successful game to date by late November 2012.StoryLazulis Island as viewed from above.The Last Story takes place on Lazulis Island. The island is the only thriving part of an empire that is suffering from poverty and decay. Zael, a mercenary and the game's protagonist, travels to the island in the hopes of finding a better life, along with the other members of his mercenary team; the leader Dagran, the dual-wielding fighter Syrenne, and the mages Lowell, Mirania and Yurick. Zael and Dagran founded the mercenary company, hoping that it would be their first step up in the world so that they might be able to escape their meager existence and one day become knights. The world of The Last Story is supposed to be one where metal resources are scarce; Sakaguchi focused on limiting the amount of sci-fi influence on the world setting, and he wants players to be able to enjoy a smooth experience of exploring Lazulis Island; a place ""bathed in the abundance of radiant sunlight.""At the start of the game, Zael, Dagran, Syrenne and Lowell are fighting their way through a cave of Reptids. When they come across an ancient ruin, they split up, and Zael and Syrenne fend off more of the creatures when Syrenne is mortally wounded by an arrow. Filled with anguish at not being able to help her, the same emotions he felt as a child kneeling over his mother, slain by bandits, he hears a voice, and is granted a strange power that allows him the ability to revive Syrenne and draw the enemy away.During his first night in Lazulis City, the populous center of the island, Zael meets a young woman named Lisa, who is on the run from the city guards. After helping her escape, Zael introduces her to his friends, and then agrees to take her to Stargazer's Tower, where they watch a meteor shower together. Lisa then parts ways with Zael and returns home.Zael's world is turned upside-down not long after he meets Calista.Later, Dagran informs the company that he's lined up a potentially lucrative job. Lady Calista, niece of Count Arganan, is to marry a nobleman named Jirall. A party to celebrate their engagement is being held at the castle, and the mercenaries have been hired to assist in standing guard due to a shortage of available bodies. However, when Zael is in the ballroom watching over the festivities, he lays eyes on Lady Calista, and realizes that she's the girl that introduced herself as Lisa.When Calista, who can't stand her fiance, steps away for a moment, Zael uses the opportunity to talk to her when Jirall follows soon after. The nobleman, a spineless fop, threatens Zael, but before the threats can be carried too far, the castle comes under attack from a fleet of Gurak ships. When Jirall cowers and flees, Zael protects Calista and tries to escort her to safety, but she's captured by Zangurak. Zael uses his power, amplified by Calista's presence, to save her before she can be taken aboard a Gurak ship. Despite this victory, the party is forced to stow away on a Gurak ship and escape after the palace cannons begin firing, putting them in danger to the complete lack of the count's knowledge.After taking over the ship, Zael and the others choose to follow the Gurak to their base, where they go on the attack and are soon joined by other Lazulis soldiers, including General Asthar and his second in command, Sir Therius. Teaming up with the knights, Zael's group manages to strike a blow against the Gurak before returning to Lazulis Island. Upon their return, however, the party is accused of kidnapping Calista and conspiring with the Gurak by Jirall, who has them cast into the dungeon. While Dagran seeks an audience with the count to set things right, Zael and the others work with Horace, an archaeologist who had also been imprisoned, and together they try to escape. But when the escape route proves to be a dead end, they're forced to turn back.Later, as Zael is about to be sentenced, much to the glee of Jirall, Calista and Asthar break into the trial, where she pleas for his life by telling everyone that going to the Gurak base was her idea. The count and Dagran soon follow, and the count asks to see Zael's right hand, which had been marked by the power granted to him in the game's beginning. Identifying it as the power of the Outsider, the power of the one who will save Lazulis Island and the Empire, the count states his case for Zael's freedom. With no other choice, the judge clears Zael of all charges. The count then offers Zael the opportunity to become a knight-in-training, serve him, and perhaps even marry Calista.Though Calistia pleads for Zael not to agree, he does so at the encouragement of Dagran. However, Zael has his doubts, which are further intensified as he begins following the count's orders, including using the power of the Outsider to make the island, in actuality a moving fortress, move on a course toward the Gurak continent in pursuit of war. Along the way, Zael seeks training from Asthar, and he ascends the Tower of Trials in order to prove his mettle as one worthy to become a true knight. During this period of time, Zael also comes under attack several times from forces working for Jirall, who has seen his engagement to Calista dissolve and what should be rightfully his taken away from him, all because of Zael.When the Gurak mount a second attack on the island, Zael and the others fight it off, but in the process, Asthar is slain by an unknown assailant. Zael, the first to the scene, is then blamed for the murder by Jirall, who uses the incident as the perfect opportunity to frame him. Because of this, Zael is once again thrown in the dungeon, this time alone. However he's not there for long when he's rescued by Calista, who has gotten over her doubts about Zael's motives and knows his intentions are pure. She sneaks him out of the castle, where they meet with the other mercenaries. Dagran and Zael sneak back in, intent on finding evidence to clear Zael, and make their way to Jirall's quarters. There, they find a letter from the Gurak as well as a blood-stained sword and are thus able to pin the blame for Asthar's murder on Jirall, who protests his innocence as the count orders he be taken to the dungeon.With Jirall incarcerated, Lazulis Island finally reaches the shores of the Gurak continent. Zael and Syrenne join the assault, only to discover that they're attacking defenseless civilians. Not an enemy solider is in sight, and worst of all, the Lazulis knights begin slaughtering and pillaging the innocent gurak. Furious, but unable to stop them, Zael is at least able to help see a small group of civilians to a safe escape before returning to the island. Disgusted by what's happened, Zael is nonetheless promised Calista's hand in marriage by the count. He finally has everything he ever wanted, but he feels awful about how it's come to him.Zael and Calista are then drawn to a mysterious voice that leads them into a strange, otherworldly space where they learn the truth of the Outsider. It is a world seed, called to the world centuries ago in a bid to stop a war from tearing the empire apart. The hero Arganan had used the power of the Outsider to intimidate everyone into an end to the conflict, and peace treaties were eventually signed. However, he also learned that the land had begun to decay because of the Outsider's power, and it couldn't be stopped. They could only slow the decay by splitting the Outsider in two. One piece was buried beneath Lazulis Castle, and the other was sent to a distant continent.On the day in which Zael is to become a knight and marry Calista, he instead rejects serving the count and flees with the support of all of his friends except Dagran, who knew that Zael would ultimately reject the offer and tries to stop him. However, Dagran ultimately puts up no fight, allowing Zael to run to Calista's side. Together, they choose to run away from the castle, but first intend to smash the controls to the Lazulis Cannon so that it can't be used any longer. But just as Zael is about to destroy the control panel, the Gurak attack once more, this time with a mobile island fortress of their own; their previous raids had only served the purpose of stealing the technology to build their own weapons to match, including their own weapon on the scale of the Lazulis Cannon.Zael and Calista meet up with the others, save for Dagran, who has gone missing, but due to the circumstances are forced to follow the count, who intends to fire the Lazulis Cannon. They venture deep into the castle depths, where they encounter half of the Outsider. The count drives the Outsider into a rage, causing the Lazulis Cannon to fire repeatedly and drain the island of its energy, but the Gurak forces aren't quelled and fire their own weapon. Eventually, the power of the Outsider engulfs the count, killing him in his mad lust to destroy his enemy. After quelling the Outsider's rage, the party splits up; half go to the aid of Therius, who is on his own fighting the enemy, and the others lead the Lazulis civilians to safety in the sewers. Though Therius is wounded in battle, he orders the others to leave him behind and protect the civilians.Sir Therius is a stickler for protocol and decorum, but despite his stiffness, he proves to be a valuable ally.Investigating a noise in the sewers, Zael's party stumbles across the enemy as the Gurak burrow their way into the island's underground. After fighting them off, the party enters the tunnels that lead to the Gurak island. In their pursuit of Zangurak, Lowell is killed, but the others continue on. Together, they find Zangurak, who bears the power of the other half of the Outsider. As they finally defeat him, Zangurak severs his right arm, still bearing the Outsider's power, so that it might allow him to be reborn. The party gives chase, only to discover Dagran as he stands in the arm's way and takes the Outsider's power as his own. It is then that Zael realizes the truth; Dagran is the traitor. He murdered General Asthar and framed Jirall, and he had been working with the Gurak the whole time. Dagran explains that he had done everything in the name of revenge. Though he had encouraged Zael with dreams of becoming a knight, he harbors hatred for the knights, as they were responsible for the deaths of his family. To Dagran, Zael and the others were just pawns.Unwilling to kill Dagran, Zael tries to plead with him, but it's no use. He and the others are forced to fight Dagran, now wielding the Outsider's power, and slay him. During their escape from the island, they come across Lowell, who is revived by a faint remnant of the Outsider's power Dagran controlled, and they continue on their way. Successfully having made their escape, they return to Lazulis Island and begin setting things right. They quickly broker peace between the humans and Gurak, as their warring was almost entirely driven by the count and Zangurak. Calista takes her place as ruler of Lazulis Island, and Zael is finally granted a knighthood, as well as Calista's hand in marriage.GameplayCombatPower of the OutsiderBoss Battle artThe game's battle system takes place in real time, but the action can be paused while issuing orders to party members. For the majority of the game, the player is in direct control of Zael, who can use his power of the Outsider for a variety of purposes. When the power is active, Zael can draw enemies to him, allowing mages time to cast spells or to ease the burden on other fighters. Downed allies can also be revived if Zael moves near them while the power is active, though each party member can only be revived a total of five times before they're knocked out for the duration of the battle.Basic CombatBy default, Zael attacks nearby enemies automatically, but this can be change to a manual attack in the game's options. When set to manual, the player can launch into a combo string of attacks, though each successive attack in a combo will gradually inflict less and less damage. More damage can be inflicted when characters work together to chain alternating attacks together.Zael is also capable of using a crossbow. When aiming with the crossbow, the perspective moves over his shoulder, similar to games like Resident Evil 4 or Gears of War. There are a variety of arrow types, including explosives, arrows that can deal extra damage to mages, and when in town, prank banana peels can be fired on the ground to slip people up.MagicMages can cast spells that produce magic circles, such as a circle that can heal allies that stand within it. Zael can use a techique called Gale to disperse the circle and impart secondary effects. Magic is also divided into elemental affinities, which are identified by their color. Each of the party's magic users excel at a different magic type.CoverZael and his allies can hide behind walls and objects in the environment for cover. Doing so may allow them a chance to ambush unsuspecting enemies or take cover from enemy archers and mages. Zael can also peek out from behind cover to use his crossbow.Customization and UpgradesEach of the player's party members can be equipped with a weapon and two armor parts (for the upper and lower body). Weapons are further divided into gear for fighters (swords, clubs, and other large instruments) and mages (various forms of daggers). Lowell is the only party member that can equip weapons from either class, while the dedicated fighter Syrenne can equip two melee weapons and dual-wield.Equipment can be upgraded at specific shops and vendors. Each time a weapon or piece of armor is upgraded, its abilities rise by a certain amount for each rank. In addition to money, armor upgrades also require material components that are typically found either in combat or in chests. Some weapons also require material components for upgrading either after reaching a certain rank or from the start. As equipment rises in rank, the rarity of the material component required for the next upgrade may also increase.Additionally, the player may collect dyes to customize the color palettes of the player characters. A purely cosmetic function, the player is never required to use it, but custom colors also carry over into the game's multiplayer component.MultiplayerThe game features online multiplayer modes for a 3-on-3 Team Deathmatch-type mode and a cooperative Boss Challenge for up to six players. These modes support random Free For All as well as private matches set up via Friend Codes.DevelopmentThe city design took inspiration from Italian architecture.Hironobu Sakaguchi, who became famous for creating the Final Fantasy series, announced in June 2009 he was working on a new game, but kept the specifics of the project a secret. Nintendo later revealed it to be The Last Story, a name that the company had trademarked months earlier. The Last Story is Mistwalker's first and only Wii project. It is also the second title that Mistwalker and Nintendo have collaborated on; the first being Archaic Sealed Heat on the Nintendo DS. Mistwalker's other previous games include the Xbox 360 RPGs Blue Dragon and Lost Odyssey.The name, music, and artwork of the game are noted to be similar in style to Final Fantasy, the long-running RPG franchise that Sakaguchi created and helped shape until his departure from Square Enix. The Last Story's character designs were created by Kimihiko Fujisaka, whose previous work includes the character designs in the Drakengard series.Limited EditionsJapanese First Print Run BonusIn Japan, every first print copy of The Last Story came with with a little freebie called The Elements of the Last Story. It contained a mini art book and a seven-track soundtrack CD in a cardboard sleeve with some fancy artwork. These goodies were also included with the European Limited Edition of the game.Japanese Limited Console BundleThere was also a Japan-exclusive Wii console bundle. It came with the previously mentioned first print bonus items, a plain white Wii console, Wii-Remote and Nunchuck along and a white Classic Controller Pro - and a copy of the game, obviously.

First-run copies also came in a special case designed to resemble a book.SoundtrackStandard Soundtrack Cover ArtThe official soundtrack by composer Nobuo Uematsu, was released in Japan as a three disc set on February 23, 2011 via Uematsu's own Dog Ear Records.

1462940,Ecto Portal,1999,SpookyAction,SpookyAction,0,0,0,"Action, Adventure",English,,,"OverviewPortal is a comedic first-person puzzle game in which the player has to escape through a series of test rooms at the behest of a shadowy research facility and a calm but ominous computerized voiceover (GLaDOS) that alternates between helpful advice and dispassionate comments about the danger of the facility and the expendability of the player character (a mute woman named Chell) to the experiment.The game uses a first-person perspective but is not an action game, per se. The player is instead attempting to get through each test chamber using their wits and various objects and fixtures in the environment, each of which has its own application. While short in length, the game is packed back-to-front with the core puzzle gameplay and conveys all its information incidentally through context clues, like posters and graffiti, and voiceover while working towards the game's goals.Portal was originally released within Valve's The Orange Box compilation, which also included Half-Life 2, its two ""Episode"" expansions and Team Fortress 2. Like Team Fortress 2, it was also made available separately at a later date. It was followed by a bigger sequel in 2011: Portal 2.StoryChell, the protagonist of PortalPortal casts players into the role of Chell, a human lab rat who awakes to find herself in the Aperture Science Enrichment Center where she is instructed by GLaDOS (Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System) that she is to take part in a series of tests. The warnings and general instructions GLaDOS provides Chell as she approaches each new test chamber provide the information she needs to complete each test while also creating atmosphere and further developing the personality of the AI as the game progresses. She is given a weapon called the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device, which can be used to create portals.The Weighted Companion CubeAs the test progresses, the difficulty of each level increases and the motives of GLaDOS become more clear as Chell comes across the remains of previous test subjects while GLaDOS's comments become more sinister and less caring than before; one bit of graffiti in the facility states emphatically that ""the cake is a lie,"" referring to the cake offered as incentive for completing the tests. At one point in the game, Chell is introduced to the Weighted Companion Cube, a simple cube with a pink heart logo on every side, which she must use to complete a test before being told it must be destroyed. It's at this point the game becomes more difficult with the introduction of live fire turrets which can kill Chell should she stand openly in range of them.After finishing the final chamber Chell is praised by GLaDOS for coming this far but she must be destroyed, forcing Chell to escape from the approaching furnace, deeper into the facility. It's at this point she realizes that there is no staff in the building. Following signs from what is possibly a previous test subject, she makes her way toward GLaDOS. The game becomes slightly more difficult in that point, because there are no more clear entrances or exits for Chell to use. So it becomes a matter of trial and error to find out which way to go. All the while, GLaDOS's comments become increasingly erratic with her mood and speech changing randomly as she tries to persuade and threaten Chell from proceeding.GLaDOSEventually, Chell enters a chamber, where a large computer AI system is hanging from the ceiling, and it is revealed that GLaDOS was in fact a computer all along. The morality core breaks and falls away from GLaDOS, who explains it was installed after she flooded the facility with a poisonous gas killing everyone and now she can do the same. A countdown timer starts, indicating how long until the facility is filled with poisonous gas. GLaDOS proceeds to fire rockets at Chell, who must use the Portal Gun to redirect the rockets toward GLaDOS. Each time one hits her, another piece of her hardware falls off which the player must retrieve using portals, then throw into the incinerator.Once every piece has been destroyed there is a portal malfunction causing everything in the room to be transported outside, where Chell is finally free. Originally, this is where the game ended, however a patch that was released on March 3, 2010 added more to this scene having a robot thank Chell for assuming the correct party escort submission position and slowly drag her away as it fades to black. Just before the credits roll, a scene unfolds, where the Weighted Companion Cube is placed beside a large cake suggesting that the cake wasn't a lie after all.GameplayThe Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device, or ""Portal Gun"" for short, allows players to easily traverse any distance instantly, so long as two portals bridge it. When the player (or any object for that matter) passes through one of a pair of portals, it instantly emerges from the other, with its orientation and momentum preserved relative to the portal. This law of conservation of momentum, which GLaDOS memorably introduces to the player as ""speedy things goes in; speedy thing comes out,"" serves as a key gameplay concept. The most common application is the gravity sling, in which the player jumps from a significant height, relying on gravity's constant acceleration to reach high speeds, before falling into a portal on the ground, and then being ""flung"" at the same high speed out of the complementary portal, often placed high on a wall. Through use of this technique, the player is able to fling him- or herself over hazards and barriers, which is essential to solving many of the puzzles in Portal.Physics also play a recurring role in Portal's gameplay. One example of this is the oversized red buttons (""1500-Megawatt Aperture Science Heavy Duty Supercolliding Superbutton"") on the ground, which the player frequently encounters. These buttons are activated when an object of sufficient mass, such as a cube or the player character herself, is positioned on top of the button. When a button is activated, it triggers an event in another object in the environment with which it is associated, such as opening a door. In most puzzles that include these buttons, cubes can also be found. The player can carry, throw, and drop cubes, including through portals, and must frequently do so in order to get cubes onto buttons that will open paths to facilitate the player's progression in the game.Another example of physics as a gameplay element in Portal is the bouncing energy balls that player encounters in many of the game's puzzles. These energy balls are emitted from an origin point and have a lifespan of approximately 15 seconds. Only one per origin point may be in existence at a time, and once one has expired, its origin point emits a new one. The energy balls travel strictly in straight lines, bouncing off of any inclined surface according to the laws of reflection. The player must additionally beware of these energy balls, as any contact with one is fatal. At the same time, the player must often redirect the path of an energy ball using portals in order to direct it into a repository, which triggers necessary events, like buttons.ContentsPortal has nineteen puzzle chambers.Portal's main mode is a story campaign, consisting of nineteen chambers with environmental puzzles, followed by a long, linear section leading directly to the final boss encounter. Most players complete Portal's story campaign in roughly three hours.In addition, Portal includes advanced and challenge maps, consisting of Chambers 13-18 from the story campaign with modifications. The advanced maps are modified to be harder by reducing the number of possible solutions so that only the more difficult one(s) remain viable, or making the existing objective more difficult to achieve. Challenge maps are played under one of three minimization goals: time, steps, or portals created. Bronze, silver, and gold medals can be earned for completing each map in within a certain limitation threshold.Portal also includes a developer commentary mode, which plays as the regular games does, except that nodes, each with an associated audio clip, are sprinkled through 11 of the 19 chambers, and the player may freely skip to any chamber containing nodes. In the audio clips, many of the Portal's designers provide insights into the level design, art direction, audio production, and technical challenges, among other issues that they grappled with while making Portal.As with the other games in The Orange Box, Portal includes achievements, which count towards the player's Xbox 360 gamerscore on that system, or Steam's own private achievement system on the PC. The two platforms' achievement sets are functionally identical.2010 Game updateA patch was released with the notes ""Changed radio transmission frequency to comply with federal and state spectrum management regulations"". Players noticed the addition of a radio to each level. These play a part in the new achievement âTransmission Receivedâ. These radios can receive a coded message; morse code, SSTV encoded images, hidden equations and mysterious sounds. Lead many people to discover a BBS line asking for authentication. The cjohnson credentials allowed streaming of ASCII images. Many believed this to elude towards a Portal 2 or Half-life 2: Episode 3 announcement. The end cut scene has been modified to solidify the return of Chell in the future. Portal 2 was later announced in the April issue of Game informer.Ending CreditsOne of the most famous features of Portal, the game's ending credits are accompanied by the song 'Still Alive'. It was written by Jonathan Coulton - a singer/songwriter who sometimes makes references to games in his songs - and performed by Ellen McLain, the actress who provides the voice for GLaDOS. McLain maintains the same mechanical tone of GLaDOS' character for the song, which enhances the humour value. ""Still Alive"" was released as a free downloadable track for Rock Band on March 31, 2008, and can also be heard on the Aperture Science Enrichment Center MySpace page; it has also been performed onstage by Coulton, most notably with Felicia Day (The Guild) and Leo Laporte (twit.tv) at PAX 2008.ApertureScience.comBefore the release of Portal, the website aperturescience.com was discovered. The website contains a text prompt, similar to DOS operating systems. Typing ""login"" or ""logon"" will prompt the user for a username and password. Any username will give access if ""portal"" or ""portals"" is entered as the password. Once logged in, the user can access an application form consisting of a long series of questions. Many of these questions seem odd and/or reference cake.During the questionnaire, certain letters will be blinking. Typing out these letters gives ""thecakeisalie"". Entering this when logged in or after finishing the application will give the player a message from an employee of Aperture Science and a video feed of the holding cell where Chell starts in Portal.During Portal, the words ""login: cjohnson password: tier3"" can be found scribbled on a wall. When logging into the website with this info, the player gets access to a history of Aperture Science. The company was originally founded by Cave Johnson as a manufacturer of shower curtains. At some point, Johnson went crazy, believing that time had begun flowing backwards, and had a team develop a ""reverse Heimlich maneuver.""SoundtrackThe soundtrack for Portal was originally released on December 21, 2007, as part of the The Orange Box Original Soundtrack. The soundtrack also contains tracks from Half-Life 2: Episode One and Two, and Team Fortress 2. The Portal soundtrack was also included on the Portal 2 ""Songs to Test By"" soundtrack, as a fourth disc exclusive to the soundtrack's collectors edition. On September 24, 2014, the Portal soundtrack was released for free as an individual package on Steam.01 - Subject Name Here02 - Taste of Blood03 - Android Hell04 - Self Esteem Fund05 - Procedural Jiggle Bone06 - No Cake For You07 - 4000 Degrees Kelvin08 - Stop What You Are Doing09 - Party Escort10 - You're Not a Good Person11 - You Can't Escape, You Know12 - Still Alive13 - Still Alive (J.C.

It is a remake of the original Final Fantasy VII, a title originally released on the Sony Playstation in 1997. FF7 Remake has been rebuilt from the ground up to be a JRPG with real-time action, fully-voiced characters, and modern graphics.Square Enix plans to release the Remake in episodic installments, with the first released April 10, 2020 (exclusively on PS4) which covers the Midgar portion of the original game. A demo was released on PSN on March 3, 2020.PlotCloud Strife is a mercenary formerly of the Shinra Electric Power Company's elite special forces known as SOLDIER, hired by a cell of the eco-terrorist group called Avalanche to aid them in the bombing of Mako Reactor 1. Both Avalanche and the cell's leader, Barret Wallace, embrace the ideals of planetology that posits that the planet is a living organism and that Shinra's harvesting of the planet's life force will lead to the end of the world.Cloud, Barret, Jessie, Biggs, and Wedge infiltrate the reactor, and Cloud sets up a bomb developed by Jessie at the core. They get out within the time limit, unaware that President Shinra was watching their every move and that he had the reactor core self-destruct when Jessie's bomb failed to detonate properly. The area surrounding the reactor is devastated by the blast. Cloud and the Avalanche members scatter into the streets and agree to meet up at the train going back to the slums.Cloud hallucinates a meeting with Sephiroth while moving through the shocked crowds, a rogue First Class SOLDIER whom Cloud remembers killing in the past. Cloud cannot believe that Sephiroth is still alive, now seemingly able to distort reality and send Cloud into a vision where everything around him is burning. Cloud snaps out of the illusion and meets a woman selling flowers being attacked by invisible monsters. Unable to see the cloak-like entities until the flower girl grabs his hand for help, Cloud's reaction alerts the Shinra Public Security forces. The woman runs away, and Shinra troops chase Cloud to the railway bridge from where he jumps onto the passing train, reuniting with the others.They head to the Sector 7 slums where Barret's Avalanche cell has a hideout in the Seventh Heaven bar owned by Tifa, Cloud's childhood friend who reconnected with Cloud after coming to Midgar for work and enlisted his services to Avalanche despite Barret's reservations. The bombing was more destructive than Jessie had anticipated, frazzles both her and Tifa, but Barret is ready to move onto the next bombing mission. However, he is not interested in hiring Cloud's services again.Tifa suggests Cloud make a name for himself as a mercenary at the Sector 7 slums and gets him an apartment next to hers. Overnight, Cloud hears moaning from the room next door, and when investigating, finds it belongs to a delirious man wearing a dark cloak whom he hallucinates as Sephiroth. As he is about to attack, Tifa stops him, and Cloud realizes it was another hallucination. Tifa helps Cloud find work around the slums, and they find Tifa's friend Johnny being taken by Shinra's Public Security under suspicion of being connected to Avalanche. Though Johnny is not part of the group, Tifa fears he might still spill something, and Cloud and Tifa save him by taking out the Shinra soldiers holding Johnny under arrest. Cloud is about to kill Johnny to make sure he will not expose Avalanche, but a shocked Tifa stops him, and Johnny instead flees Sector 7, vowing never to return.Though Barret has rejected Cloud's participation in the next bombing mission, Jessie hires him to help procure a new blasting agent from a Shinra warehouse, still thinking that her haywire bomb is what caused the previous carnage and civilian casualties. Biggs and Wedge join them, and Cloud gets to know the trio better. As they head topside by riding motorbikes through the train tunnels, they are accosted by Shinra and meet a SOLDIER Third Class called Roche, who challenges Cloud to a race. At the Shinra employees' housing district, Jessie, Biggs, and Wedge meet with Jessie's mother while Cloud sneaks in through the back to steal Jessie's comatose dad's ID card so they can gain access to the Shinra warehouse; Jessie's dad has been suffering from mako poisoning ever since an industrial accident at a Shinra plant, which was what prompted Jessie to join Avalanche.During their time topside, Cloud glimpses the starry skies and recalls a time seven years ago he had promised a 13-year-old Tifa of after entering SOLDIER; he would be her ""knight in shining armor"" and come save her if she was ever in trouble. Cloud, Biggs, and Wedge act as a diversion to buy Jessie time to find the blasting agent, and Cloud has a one-on-one duel with Roche at the SOLDIER's insistence, and Cloud asserts he is no longer affiliated with Shinra.Shinra troops overrun the place, and Wedge is hurt. Another cell of Avalanche arrives for their rescue, and after they reunite with Wedge, Jessie shows them where parachutes for Shinra maintenance workers are kept. They ride down from the plate, Cloud riding with Wedge. Back in the slums, Wedge shows Cloud where Biggs and Jessie live and shows him the cats he lives with, being known as something of a local ""cat whisperer."" After Cloud heads to Jessie's for payment for the successful mission, she hugs him and wants him to go out with her, but Cloud is reluctant to promise her anything.The mysterious invisible beings attack the Sector 7 slums the next morning, and Jessie is hurt. Barret hires Cloud as her replacement, and the mission is back on track. Barret, Cloud, and Tifa head topside on the train but fail an ID check under the updated security system and abandon the train mid-journey and trek their way to the reactor on foot. After setting up the remote-controlled bomb, they try to leave but discover that they are being broadcast to the public, live on the Shinra News. They learn that Shinra is aware of their operations and have been allowing their acts of terrorism to build Avalanche up as a public enemy the populace needs to turn to Shinra for protection. Shinra sets the bomb to detonate themselves, and after fighting a Shinra war machine, the walkway they were on is destroyed, and Cloud falls into the slums.Cloud crashes through the roof of a church onto a flower bed. He hallucinates talking to Sephiroth again but is woken up by Aerith, the woman who sells flowers he had met on the Mako Reactor 1 bombing. She is being pursued by the TurksâShinra's black ops and intelligence operations divisionâand hires Cloud to be her bodyguard to take her home safe. Cloud protects her from Reno, but they find the church being overrun by the mysterious cloaked beings. However, this time the beings do not attack, only stop Cloud from killing Reno and guide them a way out. Aerith convinces Cloud to stay the night and head back to Sector 7 the next day, and the two get to know one another better when Cloud helps her deliver flowers to the local school and when they help the local kids and other slum dwellers with their problems. They meet a delirious cloaked man with a large tattoo of the number 2 whom Cloud momentarily hallucinates as Sephiroth, but the mysterious man staggers away after the encounter. When Cloud and Aerith return to her house, they run into another Turk, Rude, whom they defeat.Aerith's mother, Elmyra Gainsborough, is not happy Aerith is getting caught up in something dangerous and despises Cloud being an Ex-SOLDIER, saying he has traded his chance for a regular life for power and thus cannot stay around Aerith. Cloud agrees to sneak out in the dead of night, but Aerith catches up with him and insists on taking him to Sector 7 anyway. On the Sector 6 park, Aerith tells Cloud about how he reminds her of her first love, who was also a SOLDIER First Class, but Cloud's vision goes blurry, and his ears begin ringing when she mentions his name.Cloud and Aerith spot Tifa being taken to Don Corneo's mansion, and Aerith insists Cloud help her, as Corneo is a dangerous crimelord. They find that Corneo is looking for a ""bride"" but only entertains women endorsed by one of the ""Trio,"" influential locals who run the notorious slum entertainment town, Wall Market. They manage to procure endorsement for Aerith from Madam M after winning a tournament at the local Corneo Colosseum and another endorsement for Cloud from Andrea Rhodea, who helps Cloud disguise himself as a woman. Once inside Corneo's place, they are subdued by gas and taken to a dungeon where they meet Tifa, who is shocked to meet Cloud dressed as a woman. Corneo makes his pick of the three, but they subdue his lackeys after their weapons and other equipment are delivered to them by Corneo's disloyal lackey Leslie Kyle working together with Andrea. Cloud, Tifa, and Aerith threaten Corneo to reveal what he knows about Shinra's plans for Avalanche. Corneo reveals that Shinra is about to drop the upper plate on the Sector 7 slums, killing countless people, to crush Barret's Avalanche cell. He then drops them into the sewers below through a trap door.Cloud, Tifa, and Aerith race back to the Sector 7 slums. The way takes them through the sewers and the Train Graveyard, which they find haunted by the captured spirits of children whom Aerith can still commune with. They free the kids' spirits by felling the demon haunting the grounds and make their way to the Sector 7 slums where they find the pillar under attack by Shinra, with the locals up in arms to protect it. Shinra announces that Avalanche is about to drop the plate and that Shinra does not negotiate with terrorists, and thus they need to give themselves up. Wedge, who was protecting the pillar along with Biggs, Jessie, and Barret, falls and is injured. Tifa and Aerith tend to him while Cloud races up the pillar, but ends up in the sights of Reno and Rude, who are the Turks on the mission to separate the plate. Reno holds a grudge toward Cloud over their previous meeting and opens fire at him. Tifa cannot bear to stay back any longer, and with Wedge recovered, she declares she will follow Cloud, asking Aerith to find Marlene, Barret's four-year-old daughter, at her bar.Wedge shows Aerith the way, but they part ways when Wedge leads the slum dwellers toward Sector 6 when a nervous Shinra Public Security soldier opens the gates against his superior's orders. Aerith finds her way to the bar even if the area becomes engulfed in flames from a downed Shinra helicopter. She finds Marlene, and the two have an instant connection, but as she leads the girl out, they are stopped by Tseng, the Turks' leader. Aerith agrees to go with him in exchange for Marlene's safety.Cloud finds a gravely injured Biggs and reunites with Tifa. They find Jessie, who dies in Cloud's arms. They find Barret atop the pillar, but Reno and Rude arrive and begin the plate separation procedure. Though Cloud, Tifa, and Barret defeat them and destroy Rude's helicopter, they fail to stop the completion of the plate separation procedure. They learn through a video message that Tseng has taken Aerith captive because she is an ""Ancient."" Reno and Rude evacuate on a Shinra medical helicopter while Cloud, Barret, and Tifa ride a ropeway to safety as the pillar separates from the plate above and it comes crashing down.Barret goes ballistic at the sight of carnage and the thought of having lost Marlene, but Cloud thinks that Marlene is safe at Aerith's house. They find her there, and Aerith's mother Elmyra tells the story of how she and Aerithânot her biological daughterâcame to meet. Aerith and her biological mother had escaped from a Shinra facility, but the mother had passed while asking a random passerbyâElmyraâto take Aerith somewhere safe. Elmyra had adopted the girl as her own but soon noticed she had mystical powers and the ability to connect to the spirits of the dead. When the Turks had come looking for her, Elmyra had learned Aerith is an Ancient, whose mystical powers Shinra wants to exploit. However, the Turks had never taken Aerith by force, and thus Elmyra still thinks Aerith is being treated well.Cloud, Barret, and Tifa return to the Sector 7 ruins where they find Wedge still alive and a secret underground testing facility where Shinra has been exposing people to mako energy to turn them into monsters. This sparks some memories in Cloud, but they are ejected from the testing site by the mysterious ghostly beings before they can investigate any further.Cloud, Barret, and Tifa carry Wedge to Elmyra's. Cloud asks again for Elmyra's permission to rescue Aerith. He believes, Aerith being the last Ancient, that she is too valuable for Shinra, especially to mad professor Hojo, to ever be released. Elmyra says she needs some time to think. Later, Cloud hears footsteps, follows them outside, and finds Aerith, Tifa, or Barret among Aerith's flowers. If the person Cloud finds is Tifa, she asks if the flower he had given her was from Aerith and cries over how Shinra has again taken everything away from them while Cloud embraces her. If Cloud meets Barret, he tells Cloud about the other Avalanche members that he never had the chance to meet and promises to introduce them after saving Aerith. If Cloud finds Aerith, he is surprised and wonders if it is a dream. Aerith talks about the importance of living in the moment as everyone dies one day and warns Cloud not to become too attached to her as she may not be able to stay with him for long. As she touches his face, she disappears, and Cloud wakes up in the guest room.The next morning, Elmyra has concluded that Cloud is right about Shinra and allows them to rescue Aerith. Barret asks her to look after Marlene and Wedge; Marlene also says Barret should help Aerith. Since the trains are not running and Shinra probably has every station under lockdown, they need an alternate route topside. Tifa suggests they ask Don Corneo, but he is not at his mansion. Instead, they find Leslie, who claims he can help them get topside on the condition they help him find Corneo in his sewer hideout. Barret does not trust him, but Cloud agrees to help.When they find Corneo's hideout, one of Corneo's pets steals the key from Leslie. Cloud, Tifa, and Barret give chase and reclaim it, only to find it was not a key but a necklace that once belonged to Leslie's fiancÃ©e. Leslie reveals that she was chosen to become one of Corneo's brides and disappeared without a trace right after. Now he wants revenge, and Barret softens up to him. They return to the hideout door, and Leslie goes in alone, but Corneo sees his attempt to kill him and disarms him. Cloud, Tifa, and Barret come to Leslie's aid, but Corneo sets a monster on them and escapes. Leslie gives Cloud and friends grappling guns to climb over the Sector 7 wall, and from there, they can reach the Shinra Building.Cloud, Tifa, and Barret make their way through the collapsed Sector 7 plate and reach the Shinra Building, and while Barret is eager to charge in through the front door guns blazing, Cloud suggests they use Shinra trucks to infiltrate the parking garage. They jump onto a truck and get inside, but when the truck leaves the checkpoint, they fall and have to fight their way in. In the lobby, Tifa makes her way inside the reception and obtain a keycard to access the rest of the building. Cloud believes Aerith is being held in the research labs near the top floors, and Tifa thinks Hojo's lab on the 65th floor is the most likely one. Either using stairs or elevators, they make their way to the 59th floor and work from there.To reach higher floors, Cloud, Tifa, and Barret act like tourists going through a tour. They experience distressing images about Midgar being destroyed by a meteor in one exhibit, and Cloud sees Sephiroth again. The image ends, and the trio meets Hart, Mayor Domino's deputy. Hart leads them to Domino, who has been the one aiding them by silencing any possible alarms from going off. He reveals he is Avalanche's man inside Shinra, as he loathes the company for locking him up in the archives and not giving him any real authority in Midgar.With Domino's help, Cloud, Tifa, and Barret reach the 64th floor, where they eavesdrop on the Shinra directors' meeting where President Shinra denies Reeve's plan to rebuild Sector 7 since they now have Aerith. Through her, they can build Neo Midgar in the promised land. Hojo believes they can use Aerith, even though she is not a pureblood Ancient, suggesting they use SOLDIER candidates to reproduce more Ancients from Aerith for Shinra to study.Cloud, Tifa, and Barret shadow Hojo as he leaves the meeting and intercept him in his lab and force him into leading them to Aerith, only to deal with one of Hojo's grotesque experiments as he escapes during the fight. The group fights their way through guards and advanced soldiers to reach Hojo, who notices Cloud has SOLDIER qualities but claims he is not a member of that force. Cloud clutches his head as his ears begin to ring, and the mysterious ghosts blow Hojo away.The group later encounters a creature chasing Hojo into an elevator, the now freed Aerith preventing a fight as she calms the creature down. The creature reveals his ability to speak to everyone's shock. Tifa notices a Roman numeral XIII tattoo on the creature, who calls himself Red XIII. Cloud is stricken again and stumbles towards the elevator, sensing that Jenova is close. He collapses and awakes in Aerith's old room in Hojo's lab, where she tells them about her Cetra heritage but how Shinra is wrong about her being able to lead the company to the promised land. They get a video message from Wedge and Domino on Avalanche HQ coming to rescue them on a helicopter from the roof, Barret being surprised as Wedge was supposed to be bedridden and he had never asked for Wedge to help bail them out.As the group goes through Hojo's lab, they find Jenova's tank, where its headless body spooks everyone. Red XIII explains Jenova is Shinra's most precious research specimen and that Hojo has spent his life studying it. A cloaked man appears in front of the tank, but everyone sees him as Sephiroth, who breaks the walkway they are on and sends everyone plummeting to the deep recesses of the lab into an area called ""The Drum"" where Hojo controls their every move and ushers more of his ""research specimens"" onto the group, only to watch them be destroyed much to his delight. The party reunites and makes their way back to where Jenova's tank was, but Jenova is gone with only a trail of dark liquid leading to the president's office.The party reaches the seemingly empty office and finds the president hanging on the side of the roof, offering them wealth to save him. Barret pulls the president up and tells him to confess to the Sector 7 collapse and that there is no Avalanche-Wutai link, only for the president to hold Barret at gunpoint while scoffing at him for only wanting to clear his name rather than asking the company to shut down all mako reactors. Sephiroth appears behind the president and kills him before stabbing Barret in the chest with his sword when he tries to protest. The ""Sephiroth"" is revealed to be another of those cloaked men, who transforms into the Jenova Dreamweaver, a monster able to create illusions. Cloud, Tifa, and Aerith destroy it, and afterward, Barret is healed by one of those ghostly mysterious beings that have begun to fly all around the Shinra Building. Another ""Sephiroth"" appears and carries away Jenova's body that has been released from the tank, and the two fall off the building.As they step onto the roof, the Avalanche helicopter that was sent out to extract them is shot down by a helicopter piloted by Reno and Rude, which brings Rufus Shinra onto the building. Rufus fights Cloud one-on-one while the others escape downstairs, though Tifa stays behind to help Cloud. Rufus is flown off by the Turks after losing the duel against Cloud, and Cloud is saved by Tifa.Cloud, Tifa, Barret, Aerith, and Red XIII escape the Shinra Building via the expressway with vehicles stolen from the Shinra exhibition rooms, taking out numerous Shinra troops and robots sent out to pursue them. At the end of the expressway, they run into Sephiroth waiting for them, everyone being able to see him now. Sephiroth cuts a passageway to thin air and disappears, telling Cloud to follow. Red XIII explains that the mysterious ghosts that have intermittently been helping or barring their advance are Whispers, arbiters of fate, and beings sent out by the planet itself to enforce a fixed future. Aerith hesitates over defying destiny but tells the others that Sephiroth is more dangerous to the planet than Shinra and must be stopped.They step through the passageway and enter a surreal realm where they fight giant Whispers as well as Sephiroth himself. How much of what they experience truly happens is ambiguous. Sephiroth is a master of projecting illusions, having trapped Cloud into illusions numerous times since he already started his journey. They witness distressing images of Aerith dying, a meteorite hurtling toward Midgar, and of a much older Red XIII witnessing a destroyed Midgar, wondering if they are glimpses of a bleak future. They defeat the giant Whispers and afterward battle Sephiroth. Although they prevail, Sephiroth remains and shows Cloud a vision of what he calls ""the edge of creation."" He implies that the world is ending and asks Cloud to embrace his plan for the planet's future. Cloud refuses but is defeated and left with a warning that he has ""seven seconds before the end.""The Whispers are defeated, and fate thus defied, the party is free to advance toward a new unknown future. Aerith misses the steel sky, deeming the new sky ahead of them unknowable. As the party leaves Midgar to pursue Sephiroth to stop whatever his plan is, people back at the ruins of Sector 7 are rebuilding, Biggs is recuperating from the injuries he had sustained at the plate's fall, revealed to have survived, and Marlene thinks of Barret with Barret declaring that he will return to her. Rufus Shinra takes over the company, pondering over Sephiroth's apparent return and the strange occurrences at the Shinra Building and Cloud and his friends' involvement. Hojo discovers that Jenova's body has disappeared from his lab and breaks into hysterical laughter.Destiny's course changed; Zack Fair has survived ""his final stand."" He is last shown bringing the delirious Cloud to Midgar, where he ended up becoming a mercenary and working for Avalanche, now wielding Zack's buster sword, but what happened to Zack himself from this point on is unknown.GameplayPlayers can switch between up to three party members in real-time, taking advantage of their attacks and abilities to defeat enemies in front of them. Though the player can only control one at a time, they can command any of them to use their unique abilities, magic spells, or items in their inventory. Being that this is only the first part of the Final Fantasy VII story, there are only four playable characters in the game: Cloud, Barret, Tifa, and Aerith. Red XIII does make an appearance in the latter part of the game, but is not controllable and is treated as a guest character. Unlike in the original, the party is determined by the story and cannot be adjusted manually.Additionally, an option for a Classic Mode is available. More akin to an easy mode, in Classic the game will take control of the characters during battle while the player can activate any ATB commands. Direct control of the characters is still possible if desired.New Game+ and Hard ModeOnce the game has been completed, there is the option to replay the game with all earned items and abilities, as well as being able to play in hard mode, via Chapter Selection. Some weapon manuscripts are only obtainable in Hard Mode.Limit BreaksMuch like in the original game, each character has a set of Limit Breaks, that can cause significant damage. Whereas the original game had four levels of Limit Breaks with a total of seven per character, Remake only has two per character. New Limit Breaks are acquired in Chapter 9 for Cloud and Aerith and in Chapter 14 for Barret and Tifa. When a new Limit Break is acquired, it can be equipped in the Battle Settings menu. Only one Limit Break can be equipped at a time. To use a Limit Break, a limit gauge will fill during battle when attacked or staggering enemies. Once the gauge is filled, an option to use a Limit Break will appear in the battle menu. Limit Breaks cannot be saved between battles: if it activates during a normal fight, it's best to use it then and there.Cloud's Limit Breaks: Cross SlashAscensionBarret's Limit Breaks: Fire in the HoleCatastropheTifa's Limit Breaks: SomersaultDolphin FlurryAerith's Limit Breaks:Healing WindPlanet's ProtectionThe refocus materia is an additional Limit Break that can be equipped by anyone giving that character two options during battle. Refocus allows the character to have three ATB bars allowing for faster charge. ",,,,,,,,,

The game features are large number of units, all representing different ""bugs"",    ants, spiders, beetles,   cockroaches etc. All sport different abilities, special skills etc. In order to win, the player must apply those very abilities and skills in order to achieve the goal of the map. Some bugs may be fast but weak, others can throw  bombs or are exceptionally strong in defense. The game lacks any sort of resource or building managment and purely focusses on the units and the battle tactics.

A prequel to the horror drama television series The Walking Dead (which itself is based on the comic book series of the same name), players assume the role of Southern hunter Daryl Dixon as he, along with his brother Merle, travels through rural U.S.A. at the beginning of the zombie apocalypse.Unlike most first-person shooters involving zombies, progressing through the game requires heavy resource management as ammunition, food, and other equipment are scarce (encouraging exploration through the environment).GameplayThe Walking Dead: Survival Instinct is a first person game with survival and stealth mechanics. Players will be required to manage resources while trekking through zombie infested Georgia. Daryl is able to use both melee weapons and long ranged weapons. Ammo is scarce and the game encourages players to explore the semi-open world environments in order to find ammo and other useful objects such as bandages.Like in games such as ZombiU, one zombie can easily overcome the player. Firing a gun can attract enemies while flashing a light on a zombie will also attract it towards the player. Zombies are also sensible to the player's smell (a recurring theme in both the graphic novel and the TV series) meaning that zombies can find Daryl even if they can't see him. Daryl will be able to kill zombies in one shot by sneaking up behind them for a stealth kill.Throughout the game, players can recruit up to four survivors to join their group. Players can then send survivors to go and collect supplies. Each survivor has different stats indicating whether or not they'll be able to survive the trip for supplies. Furthermore, the story will force the players to leave survivors behind, a death sentence in zombie infested Georgia.",,,,,,,,,

The freeware game is basically a Donkey Kong clone with several game modes (or skins) based on movies from the 80s and 70s. Each skin has different graphics, sound effects and music that changes according to the film it is based upon. Game SkinsThere are 10 basic game skins based on films. The player's game character changes according to those skins and in some cases according to the level.Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) - Indiana JonesAlien (1979) - Ellen RipleyStar Wars (1977) - Luke Skywalker, Han SoloBig Trouble in Little China (1986) - Jack BurtonFirst Blood (1982) , Rambo: First Blood Part II (1985), Rambo III (1988) - John James RamboFlash Gordon (1980) - Flash GordonTotal Recall (1990) - Douglas QuaidConan The Barbarian (1982) - Conan the CimerianGremlins (1984) - Billy PeltzerThe Exorcist (1973) - Father Lankester Merrin, Father Damien KarrasGameplayWhile each skin has very different graphics, sound and music, the basic gameplay is virtually the same one each mode and reminiscent of the original Donkey Kong. Difficulty and dangersThe actual game can be considered somewhat hard (specially among new school gamers) because of the classic basic old school mechanic. The player character can only take one hit before dying. Touching a chasing enemy, a 'boulder' or one of the obstacles will terminate the player life. Also falling from a level higher than the player's sprite will kill the character. However, new lives are available every 7000 points and the player gets points just for walking as well as for successfully jumping over an enemy (100 points).Bonus MarkerA bonus marker in the top right section of the game screen acts as a stage timer: It will decrease at each passing second in the stage and if the player has not finished the level when it reaches 0, he will loose his current life. On the other hand, finishing a stage very quickly will reward the player with thousands of points, which are useful for getting more lives.Special Attack ItemsEach level has at least 2 special attack items which are floating above the second and upper platforms. Those items change according to each film skin (they can be knives, swords, axes, guns, flamethrowers, blasters, rifles, drills, etc), but they are based on the 'hammer' from the original Donkey Kong. To obtain an item the player only has to touch the item by jumping on it.While using the attack item a different music soundtrack will begin and the player will be able to destroy incoming enemies and obstacles which will reward him with several points, but he can't jump or climb a ladder while using it.Also, placing the character below a platform not higher than the player's sprite will enable him to destroy enemies above him. However, the item only lasts for a few seconds, so you have to be careful not to lose it while being too close to an enemy. LevelsThere are 3 different basic stages on each level of every film skin. Completing those first three levels will reward the player with an end of level special screen and begin a new set of 3 harder stages, with different obstacles and different platform configurations each. A medal with the number of the completed level will appear in the upper part of the screen once it has been finished.FruitsBesides the special attack items several different 'fruits' will appear floating in the platforms of each stage. These will reward the player with bonus points if obtained.",,,,,,,,,

It was originally released on Steam Early Access on September 19, 2022. It is the first in the series to receive both a digital release and a worldwide release.A revival of the studio's Train Simulator series (after a 15-year hiatus since Railfan: Taiwan High Speed Rail), JR East Train Simulator has players driving passenger trains through parts of multiple JR East lines in Japan. The base game includes a small portion of each of the three initial routes (TÅkaidÅ Line, ChÅ«Å Line Rapid, and Åito Line), and makes use of full-priced DLC expansions for the full JR East sections of those routes.As with the rest of the Train Simulator series, JR East Train Simulation uses high-definition live-action cab footage as full-motion video for the outside view, with the speed of the video playback adjusted for the train's speed to give the illusion of driving a real-life train. Based on the industrial train simulators Ongakukan produced after the release of Railfan, much of the game's physics and soundscape are authentic, with the cab instruments based on official specifications.RoutesTÅkaidÅ Line (E233-3000 series EMU) - Tokyo -> Shinagawa (Basic) -> Atami (Full)ChÅ«Å Line Rapid (E233-0 series EMU) - Takao -> HachiÅji (Basic) -> Tokyo (Full)Åito Line (211 series EMU) - Matsumoto -> Azusabashi (Basic) -> Minami-Otari (Full)The Early Access version of the game included two different routes with short distances, none of which are playable at this time:KeihinâTÅhoku Line (E233-1000 series EMU, southbound) - Omiya -> UrawaHachikÅ Line (KiHa 110 series DMU, inbound) - Takasaki -> Gunma-Fujioka",,,,,,,,,

Waves come two-at-a-time, from opposing directions, and only one ever matches the player's avatar. Upon matching, the game selects new colors, and the player must again match to the new correct wave. This continues until the avatar touches the wrong wave first, causing a game over.Challenge is added gradually as the waves speed up, and as a new obstacle is spawned at the location of every match. The player is awarded a power-up on every 7th match. The player can activate most power-ups by bouncing off of the obstacle that has been marked by that power-up's icon.",,,,,,,,,

The player is given a small, mostly empty dungeon with some low-level, low-rank monsters at the start of the game, and must improve their dungeon by filling the dungeon with battle arenas and trap rooms, as well as leveling up and recruiting monsters. This is accomplished by selecting one of three action cards on a ""board"", typically involving fighting waves of enemies with a reward after completion. There are also other cards that will give the player unique options, such as Merchant cards for purchasing more monsters/rooms and fusing monsters into more powerful ones, and Dungeon cards, which allow the player to recover life or read books which give varying boosts, for example.Each card selected counts for one day in the dungeon, and every 20 days a boss horde will appear, which typically features more powerful enemies and a set of buffs and/or debuffs which can make these more difficult. When the player is defeated, they are given experience points based on their score for that run, leveling up their dungeon lord and building up currency that can be used to unlock everything from more monsters, traps, and lords to more permanent upgrades like expansion of the dungeon or the ability to keep monsters/rooms from previous runs.While players can purchase card packs via microtransactions, all in-game content can be unlocked without purchasing these packs.

A Nintendo Switch version is in development (by Panic Button).The fifth main installment of the Doom series and the direct sequel to the 2016 game Doom, Doom Eternal is the first game to run on the id Tech 7 engine and revamps the predecessor's mechanics (including an updated weapon roster, new mobility options, a new assortment of monsters, and new upgrade systems).Set sometime after the Doom Slayer recovered the Crucible and closed the rift between Mars and Hell, Doom Eternal takes place during a time where most of Earth have been conquered by a demonic invasion (similar to Doom II: Hell on Earth). Players reprise the role of the Doom Slayer, now in command of his own massive Sentinel space station (the ""Fortress of Doom"") as he hunts down the three Hell Priests commanding the invasion (as well as their leader, the Khan Maykr). Some of the background lore from the previous game (including the Night Sentinels) is explored more directly in this installment.Unlike the previous installment, the game includes no competitive multiplayer or level creation system on top of the main campaign. Instead, the game includes ""Battlemode"", an asymmetrical multiplayer round-based arena mode where one ""Slayer"" player is pitted against two ""Demon"" players (each of them controlling an enemy directly, similar to the Demon Rune of the previous game, while being able to summon minions). An ""Invasion"" mode is in development, allowing ""Demon"" players to infiltrate the single-player campaigns of other players (similar to the Souls series).Those who pre-ordered the game received a copy of the updated port of Doom 64 for free.",,,,,,,,,

Designed, developed, and produced almost solely by himself (the soundtrack was composed by            James Bennett). In it, you simply have to make it to the end of the level, avoiding traps and other annoying hazards that hinder your progress towards the end of the game. The game is downloadable in three different forms from     www.love-the-game.com.GameplayControlsLove controls very simply. The player moves using the arrow keys, and          jump using the 'A' key. The controls are customizable via the main menu. There are other, more advanced command that are valuable to your success - pressing 'S' will save the player's position on the map (as long as they are on solid ground) so that if the player dies, they'll         respawn at that spot, consuming one of their hundred lives in the process. If the player finds himself stuck, he can press up and 'S'. It kills the character and respawns him at the current saved position. Pressing the down key and 'S' at the same time will reset the save, allowing the player to get out of a position they may not be able to otherwise. The game's window is very tiny when the game is launched, but it can be resized by dragging the corner of the screen or going fullscreen by pressing 'F4'.GameplayAs stated before, the player has one hundred lives (after which there is a       Game Over screen that makes a speech about how useless the player is) to make it to the end of the 20 levels and 4 bonus levels, which are filled with dangerous spikes, pits, lasers, water and all kinds of deadly thing one would encounter in everyday life. Each level has a different theme, and with it different kinds of platforming/jumping puzzles. The levels range from a 'water facility': where one has to navigate their way around fountains, leaks in the ceiling and crumbling platforms to a cave of some sort where the player has to start spelunking their way through a maze of  Temple of Doom-like traps and platforms. The air movement is very sharp, but not momentum based like other platformers - one can stop very precisely in midair and start again in the same jump. There is no run speed or anything of the sort, but the Super Mario Bros. feature of holding down the jump button for extra height on the jump is included.SoundtrackLove's soundtrack is composed by James Bennet of Sheffield, UK. Bennet describes his music (and thus the game's soundtrack) like ""a 45-year old ice cream van making its way to the moon"". The soundtrack is available for anyone who financially supports the game. The game contains 11 tracks of music, all played throughout the course of the game. At least two of the tracks featured in Love can be found on            Bennett's MySpace.External Links            Love             James Bennet (some tracks from Love are listenable here)           James Bennet's Last.fm (even more tracks are listenable here, including the title screen music)",,,,,,,,,

The object of the game is to navigate the forest and collect eight manuscript pages relating to the mysterious, malevolent creature known as the Slender Man. As the player moves around the game world they risk encountering the Slender Man, who is capable of teleporting from place to place, and can appear in front of the player at any time. His appearance is accompanied by a loud burst of strings and as the player stares at him their screen will fill with static. If the player views the Slender Man for too long they will lose the game, the final image they see being the Slender Man very close to them and ""staring"" back through the static. With each page the player collects, the audio becomes more intense and they increase their risk of encountering the Slender Man.Over time the battery in their flashlight will also drain. Turning the flashlight off will prevent the battery from draining and also increase the amount of time they can look at the Slender Man before losing, but it also makes it easier for the Slender Man to find them. In addition to normal movement the player can also run for as long as their stamina will allow, with their stamina slowly recharging once they've stopped running. However, the player's maximum stamina will decrease as they continue to sprint over the course of the game.SequelOn September 20, 2012 a sequel to Slender: The Eight Pages called Slender: The Arrival was announced by the original Slender creator Mark Hadley. It will feature improved graphics, multiple levels, and a storyline crafted by Joseph DeLage, Troy Wagner and Tim Sutton - the forces behind the landmark ""slender series"" Marble Hornets. The game is planned to launch on PC and Mac sometime in 2013, and is being jointly developed by Hadley's ParsecProductions and Blue Isle Studios- an independent game design company based out of Toronto, Canada. Slender: The Arrival will be a commercial release available for something ""less than $20"", unlike it's freeware predecessor.",,,,,,,,,

This makes it easier to manipulate, do boolean options (addition/subtraction) on the data to cut out holes, add details while the structure remains solid and intact, and easy-to-access data structures to bounce light through.[5]Geometry shader: Injects point lights into cascaded volume textures.[4]Lighting:[5]Cascaded voxel cone ray tracing: New lighting technology developed by Q-Games, which simulates lighting in real-time and uses more realistic reflections rather than screen space reflections.[8] A variation of voxel cone tracing,[4] it involves calculating and storing light and its direction around the player character as she moves in ever increasing cascades of data.[5] It supports multi-bounce cone tracing, with up to 3 bounces of indirect lighting,[9] and cone tracing in 16 directions.[4]Direct lighting: Sky lighting (represented as 16 spherical radial basis functions aligned to 16 cone tracing directions), point lights (using geometry shader), and emission.[4]Global illumination: Real-time global illumination, with cascaded voxel cone ray tracing,[4] in real-time, without any need for pre-calculated or pre-baked lighting.[1][2] It supports direct and indirect illumination in real-time,[4] and up to three bounces of light per pixel from all directions (compared to one bounce for Pixar films).[5]Screen space occlusion:[3] Screen space directional occlusion (SSDO).[4]Shadows: Cone tracing used to generate shadows rather than shadow maps,[9] with shadows generated from occlusion accumulated by cone tracing.[4]Subsurface scattering, with translucency.[3]Volumetric lighting.[5]Materials system: Supported materials include carved wood and translucent materials.[3] ",,,,,,,,,

Unfortunately, the City is broiling with social tension as it is ravaged by a plague and lorded over by a political tyrant known as the Baron. In order to survive his adventures, Garrett will have to pay attention to his environment and make use of the many possible paths through each of the game's levels.This game is a reboot of the franchise taking away some of the prominent elements of the previous game's stories such as magic and the Hammerites.It was confirmed by the studio's audio director Jean-Christophe Verbert that voice actor Stephen Russell won't reprise his role as Garrett because the new game is using full motion capture so they can capture the voice at the same time as the actors' movements and facial expressions and therefore needed an actor that can voice Garrett while doing his own stunts.PC System RequirementsMinimumOS: Windows Vista with platform updateCPU: High-performance dual core CPU or quad core CPURAM: 4 GBGraphics Card: AMD Radeon 4800 series / Nvidia GTS 250DirectX: DirectX 10HDD/SSD: 20 GBRecommendedOS: Windows 7 or 8CPU: AMD FX 8000 series or better / Intel i7 Quad Core CPURAM: 4+ GBGraphics Card: AMD Radeon HD / R9 series or better / Nvidia GTX 660 series or betterDirectX: DirectX 11HSS/SSD: 20GB",,,,,,,,,

1457930,Red Rage,99,Snakebite Studios,Snakebite Studios,0,0,0,"Action, Indie",English,,,"OverviewGuns and dune buggies: some of the most common things you can find in the post-apocalyptic wastelands of Earth.Rage (stylized as RAGE) is a sci-fi post-apocalyptic open-world first-person shooter (with vehicular combat segments) developed by id and published by Bethesda for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and PC on October 4, 2011.Built on the developer's then-latest game engine (id Tech 5), Rage takes place on a post-apocalyptic future Earth that is recovering from an asteroid impact. Players take the role of the last surviving member of an Ark (an underground shelter constructed to ensure humanity's survival long after the impact) as he wakes from cryostasis only to be hunted down by bandits, mutants, and a powerful military force known as the Authority.Along with the game's traditional first-person shooter segments, Rage also features third-person vehicular combat with customizable dune buggies as the protagonist's main form of transportation. Unlike id's previous games, Rage features some RPG elements (including a dedicated inventory system with looting and crafting), bonus mini-games (including a collectible card game known as ""Rage Frenzy""), and an open-world system with side missions. Unlike all previous first-person shooters from the developer since Doom, Rage does not include traditional deathmatch multiplayer. Instead, players can play either separate two-player co-operative missions (Legends of the Wasteland) or four-player arena-based vehicular rally racing (Road Rage).The game received a mobile-focused spin-off for iOS devices on November 18, 2010. Titled RAGE HD, players fight through episodes of the in-universe game show ""Mutant Bash TV"" (hosted by the eccentric J.K. Stiles). It is played in a similar first-person shooter fashion as the main game and is known as an early example of the platform's graphical capabilities.LevelsWaking UpQuell the Bandit ThreatMedical SuppliesFind the Buggy PartsDestroy the BarricadeDan's MessageWellspringFeltrite CraterFeltrite SampleDefibrillator UpgradeCuprino NeededMutant Bash TVResupply the TowerDestroy the Bomb CachesHijacked WellDeadly DeliveryLiberate Captain MarshallRecover ID DriveLost Research DataSubway TownGaining InfluenceMutant ExpansionGearhead VaultThe Price of PowerAbandoned DistilleryArk EquipmentAssault the Authority BridgeAssault Capital PrimeDLC - Wasteland Sewer MissionsA DLC package is available on the Xbox 360 called 'Wasteland Sewer Missions'. It add 9 additional sewers to the game. The DLC unlocks the already present sewers in the game. Anyone with the Anarchy edition already had them unlocked.DLC - The ScorchersA second DLC package known as The Scorchers was released on December 18th, 2012 for Xbox360, PlayStation3, and PC for $5. It includes a short mission based campaign against The Scorchers, new weapons, new environments, and the ability to continue playing the game after completing the main story. Also included in the DLC update was a new ""Ultra Nightmare"" difficulty level.The id Tech 5 EngineVehicles play an important role throughout the game.The Id Tech 5 Engine marks the first engine designed around ""visualizing texture data"", whatever that means. The idea is to allow artistic freedom by improving the engine's handling of textures - they can be any size or resolution, and it will have no impact on engine performance. The only limitations remaining are storage on the disc/hard drive, and the artist's imagination. This takes away the struggle between realism and performance'.While this is one major selling point to developers, the engine is also being designed with cross-platform capabilities in mind, at least as far as the platforms it's being released on. This means that a developer could compile their game for PS3, and then immediately compile another version for the Xbox 360, and then another for Windows, without ever needing to change any of the assets, code, etc. This also works for Mac OS X and Linux - and because the engine is OpenGL 2 and DirectX 9 compliant, it will work on versions of Windows before Vista as well.id Software has traditionally focused on providing a solid, stable, and highly scalable engine, while all content creation tools were designed from a technical standpoint, and with less focus on the artist's job. id Tech 4 (the engine used for Doom 3) had all of its development tools built in the game executable to allow for real time editing, but it still possessed the beauty-to-performance tradeoff that made beauty passes such a headache. However, for id Tech 5, id will introduce ""id Studio"", a real-time collaborative editing platform (thus far only planned for release on Windows). While it resembles CryTek's Sandbox Editor in function, the premise of id Studio is that more than one editor can work on the same level collaboratively. Given the engine's texturing capabilities, it can be best described as bringing a few friends over to work on a Lego set together, except replacing Lego with clay and paint.EngineeringThe player has the ability to build items out of the various scraps that can be found around the wasteland. Some of these items can be purchased from the various vendors in the game, but some can only be found in certain areas of the game. The majority of the schematics can be purchased while a select few have to be acquired though completing missions or exploration of the wasteland. Below is a list of all the items that can be built in Rage, the advanced builds replacing the standard ones.ItemsRequiredAuthority AugmenterNanotrite Conduit(2), Electrical Wire Kit, Feltrite Coupler, Feltrite Power PackRegenerative InfusionBandages, Comet Bloom(2), Vial of BlueshineAdvanced Sentry TurretOrdnance Pack, Turret Barrel, Nanotrite Conduit, Small Battery Pack, Electrical Wire KitAdvance Sentry BotOrdnance Pack, Nanotrite Conduit, Small Battery Pack, Electrical Wire Kit, Hardware PacketAdvanced WingsticksSteel Blades, Hardware Packet, Electrical Wire KitEMP GrenadeElectrical Wire Kit, Feltrite Power Pack, HE Grenades(3)Dynamite Bolts â Crossbow AmmoSteel Bolts(6), Explosive PackMind Control Bolts â Crossbow AmmoSteel Bolts(12), Explosive Pack, Ghost Toxin, Mutant Adrenal Gland(2)Advanced RC Bomb CarExplosive Pack, Nanotrite Conduit, Small Battery Pack, RC Car KitPop Rockets â Shotgun AmmoBuckshot(16), Explosive PackFat Mamas â Pistol AmmoFatboys(12), Explosive PackApophis InfusionDesert Spore(2), Bandages, Night Blossom(2)Lock GrinderElectrical Wire Kit, Hardware Packet, Small GearsAdrenaline OverdriveBandages, Night Blossom, Mutant Adrenal GlandBandagesCloth Rags, Antiseptic FormulaRacingDriving is the main way the player will traverse the wastelands in Rage, and said wastelands are hostile places. Filled with bloodthirsty bandits and the vicious Authority, the cars in Rage are heavily weaponized, equipped with guns, rocket launchers and have strong defensive capabilities too, such as shields, friendly turrets and mines. Apart from the ATV, the cars can be customized in regards to the tires, engines, armor and how much boost they can store. Below is a list of the class types for the vehicles and the weapons and defenses that are in the game.Car nameDescriptionJetter - ATVThis will be the first vehicle players acquire, a simple ATV that cannot be customised in any way. The player canât use the defence items while driving this either.Dune Buster - BuggyThis is gained by completing an early story mission and be equipped with one weapon at a time, which has to be switched out at the garage.Cuprino - TruckThis is also gained by completing a story mission, has far more durability than the buggy and can be equipped with two weapons simultaneously. Players can also fit custom bumpers to the front, that deal heavy damage when driving at high speed.Monarch â APCThis is the only vehicle that isnât obtained through a story mission, when talking to Redstone in Subway town, he advises the protagonist to get a stronger vehicle to fight the authority. Players must go and speak to the racer on the bottom floor of the town, beat him in the race and the Monarch is available. The main difference this vehicle has is the addition of the pulse cannon, which is a devastating energy weapon that deals massive damage to vehicles. Like the Cuprino, players can equip armor and a rammer on the front.WeaponsWeaponDescriptionMinigunsStandard dual mounted miniguns that can store a very large amount of ammo. They are not effective for taking down armoured vehicles, such as the Cuprino and Monarch.Rocket LaunchersThese fire homing rockets that take down most un-armoured vehicles in one shot. There is a short delay for lock-on targeting, but line of sight firing is possible.Pulse CannonA single shot weapon that has a significant cool down between each shot. Especially effective at taking down armoured vehicles. This can be only fitted to the Monarch.Defence ItemsItemDescriptionShieldProvides complete protection from all damage taken by the player's vehicle. Has a limited time of use.Armour RestoreCompletely repairs all damage that the player's vehicle has taken.Drop MineStationary mine that will detonate upon contact with any vehicle, even the player's verhicle.AftershockerSends out a powerful shockwave that will blast away all vehicles in a given radius around the player.Hover TurretA small friendly turret will hover above the player's vehicle and automatically target hostile targets.Escort BombDeploys an RC bomb car that will follow players and detonate near hostile targets such as cars and turrets.Easter EggsRage has quite a few Easter Eggs in it many of which reference other id Software games. Many of the id references come in the form of special items around the world that can be sold for large amounts of money.In one of the levels there is a reference to ""Rage 2"" and ""Doom 5"". Perhaps regarding future releases.At the beginning of the game there is a Doomguy bobble-head on the dashboard of Dan Hagar's buggy.Players find a Vault Boy bobble-head on the desk of the mayor in Wellspring. The game even describes it as being Vault-Tec paraphernalia leading Brad Shoemaker and Vinny Caravella to debate whether or not RAGE takes place in the same world as Fallout or that the game simply takes place in a world that Fallout existed in as a game.There are ""Quayola"" crayons that bare the Quake logo on them.In the game there are several boxs of ""Pinkies"" that bears resemblance to a box of Twinkies but makes the roaring sound that a Pinky makes in Doom when it is picked up.In the Wasteland Garage there are three hidden buttons, when pressed they make a noise from Quake and when players press all three of the buttons they can go up some stairs that were previously un-passable. The stairs are located where a Quake Logo is on the wall leading into a Quake style portal at the top of the stairs. The portal takes players to an original Quake level where the difficultly level would normally be chosen. On the ground, players find an item called a ""Shambler Plush"".In the Distillery in the Eastern Wasteland the stills have logos on them that look very much like the ""No. 7"" that can be found on Jack Daniel's bottles.In the Abandoned Distillery there is a hidden developer room with all the developer signatures and an ""ID"" logo. It also unlocks the Achievement ""Dev Graffiti"" after entering the room.In the Gearhead Vault there are a bunch of computers with keyboards by them. Press the interact key on a keyboard and a sound from Doom will play. When players interact with all the keyboards a growl will be heard, that means a door has been unlocked. If players go through the door which is at the start of the vault by a flaming barrel, then players will enter a room with a portal on the ground. Upon going through the portal, players end up in the original level from the shareware version of Doom. In the level is an item that can be picked up called ""Doom Marine Bobblehead"" it is the same one that is on Dan Hagar's dashboard.When players first enter the Gearhead base there is a bandit sweeping the floor and whistling a tune that is just shy of being ""Whistle While You Work"".In one of the first quests, players can access a room that resembles a cell block from the Wolfstein 3-D. The room contains a trophy that 'has a German design to it'.Players can paint cars with the iD logo.PC System RequirementsBelow are the official PC system specifications that Bethesda announced on their blog in September 2011.MinimumOS: Windows XP SP3, Windows Vista, Windows 7Processor: Intel Core 2 Duo or AMD EquivalentMemory: 2 GBHDD Space: 25 GBVideo Card: Geforce 8800, Radeon HD 4200RecommendedOS: Windows XP SP3, Windows Vista, Windows 7Processor: Intel Core 2 Quad or AMD EquivalentMemory: 4 GBHDD Space: 25 GBVideo Card: Gefore 9800 GTX, Radeon HD 5550Rage also uses Steamworks and feature Steam Achievements, VOIP (Voice over Internet Protocol), and Friends Support.",,,,,,,,,
1457940,Yuha's Nightmares,0,Supr Experience,Supr Experience,0,0,0,"Adventure, Casual, Indie, Simulation","English, Russian",,," Gameplay:Little Nightmares is a Limbo-like 2.5D platformer that is based around evading the grasp of various substantially larger horrors that attempt to capture you. The game features light puzzle solving but is primarily a stealth game. Navigating most areas revolves around baiting the large horrors away from whatever exit you are attempt to reach. If one of these horrors does manage to catch you, the game is immediately over. Unlike games like Limbo and Inside, the player-character is very rarely brutalized upon being captured instead fading to black instead.   Plot Overview:*Contains Spoilers The plot of Little Nightmares is very open to interpretation as the game contains no dialogue or written word. The main character is a small raincoat wearing creature that breaks out of the brig of a large seafaring vessel. The first stage revolves around escaping the brig by avoiding a lethal blinding light that turns the player to stone should they get caught. Once free of the prison, the player must navigate past a long armed creature seemingly placed in charge of preparing prisoners for the chefs to cook upstairs. This functions as stage two and is the longest in the game. This creature is blind and relies on sound to track you down. After a lengthy chase through the midsection of the ship, the long armed horror corners the small creature. Through quick thinking, it manages to crush the horror's long arms under a door allowing for a hasty escape. Stage three is the kitchen where the small creature observes the grisly preparation of a whole myriad of meats. The chefs that run the kitchen make every attempt to capture the small creature before it once again manages to evade capture. In between stages, the small creatures finds itself needing to feed on larger and larger prey this time consuming a large rat. At the start of the fourth stage, the small creature emerges from a porthole to spot a parade of horribly obese humanoid creatures boarding the now docked ship. The small creature then has to move through the lavishly decorated dining hall to reach its true target upstairs. This stage features a lot of hiding in plain sight as the obese creatures are typically too enamored with their meals to pursue the small creature.The final stage revolves around destroying a slender geisha monster that cannot bare to see its own reflection. The small creature moves through its ghostly chambers in search of a mirror that it hasn't yet destroyed. Once procured, the small creature forces a direct encounter with the geisha forcing it to witness it's reflection. Upon using this to disable it, the small creature consumes the geisha monster granting it new power. From there, the small creature escapes up to the main deck and onward to freedom.  ",,,,,,,,,

1458040,Tales of Arise Demo Version,,,,0,0,0,,,,,"OverviewBandai Namco's latest Tales of... game was announced at E3 2019 during the Microsoft press conference, and was released worldwide on most platforms on September 9, 2021 (with a Steam release one day later). The latest Tales title has multiple changes from previous games in the franchise, including a new engine using Unreal Engine 4 as the base, different art style, and updated gameplay mechanics.PlotThe planet of Rena has ruled over the world of Dahna for 300 years, taking its resources and enslaving its people by dividing Dahna's territory with walls and appointing five Lords to rule over its people. Most Dahnans have been so beaten down they revere Dahna and hope to one day join it, but a select few seek to rebel against their oppressors and free Rena from Dahna's grasp.In this setting, a Dahnan man in an iron mask without his memories who can't feel pain rescues a Renan woman with a curse that brings pain to everyone who touches her. The two soon join forces, hoping to defeat all five Lords and overthrow their Renan oppressors.Main CharactersAlphenVA: Takuya Sato (JP) | Ray Chase (EN)A Dahnan slave who lost his memories and his ability to feel pain, initially named ""Iron Mask"" for the iron mask that he wears and is unable to take off. With Shionne's help, he is able to wield a Blazing Sword that would normally kill most people, and slowly regains memories of his past life as Alphen, going on a journey with her to destroy the Renan Lords and free all Dahnans from their oppressors. He also enjoys cooking food with lots of spices that are too much for most people to handle.ShionneVA: Shino Shimoji (JP) | Erica Lindbeck (EN)A Renan woman who delivers a painful ""Curse of Thorns"" to anyone who touches her. She teams up with Alphen after he is the only one to not recoil in pain from her curse, and is on a mission to defeat the five Renan Lords. She wields a magical rifle and grenades in combat, and enjoys eating a wide variety of food.RinwellVA: Sayuri Hara (JP) | Christine Marie Cabanos (EN)A Dahnan Mage who is somehow able to use Astral Artes that were thought to only be usable by Renans, by chanting incantations with her books. She risks her life to get help for the Dahnan resistance in Cyslodia. Rinwell travels with a small owl named Hootle.LawVA: Yoshitsugu Matsuoka (JP) | Bryce Papenbrook (EN)A Dahnan man who works for Rena's Bureau of Observation, a secret police organization in Cyslodia tasked with hunting down Dahnan dissidents. He initially tries to arrest Alphen, but later joins him on his quest after seeing his father murdered by the Renan Lord he served. A skilled martial artist who prefers solving problems with his fists rather than his head, he can shatter rocks and armor with his fists alone.KisaraVA: Haruna Ikezawa (JP) | Katelyn Gault (EN)The strongest Dahnan soldier who serves directly under Dohalim in Elde Menancia. After seeing her brother sacrifice himself for Dohalim's ideals, she decided to join him and Alphen on their quest. Kisara dresses in a full suit of armor, wielding a tower shield and mace, and will block enemy attacks while the others dodge. She can also use her shield to stop enemies from charging and instantly down them for a few seconds.Dohalim il QarasVA: Yasuyuki Kase (JP) | Griffin Puatu (EN)The mild-mannered Renan Lord of Elde Menancia who transformed his domain into a peaceful land for Dahnans and Renans alike. He is well-versed in various forms of art. After surviving a coup attempt and admitting that his motives were not so noble, Dohalim abdicates his seat of power to travel with the others, hoping to spread his ideals to the rest of the world. Dohalim wields a staff in combat, and can use earth-based Astral Artes.GameplayArise retains some similarities to previous mainline title Tales of Berseria in having a party of up to six characters where four can battle at any one time, the two reserves can be swapped in as needed, and fighting is done on a fully 3D plane instead of a largely 2D plane with sprites. Beasts are no longer randomly encountered on the world map, but monsters with their own attitudes who can be fought or avoided as needed. Unlike other games, enemies will no longer drop gald by themselves, though some may drop items that can be sold.Combat is slightly different, keeping the use of AG diamonds to pull off various Artes in lieu of a mana point system, but all healing-type Artes pull from a shared pool of Cure Points (CP) that does not regenerate on its own, and can only be restored with specific Gels or resting at a campsite or inn. CP can also be used by characters outside of battle to accomplish extra tasks, like removing a wall of flame or healing an NPC.Characters can also make food in the field based on recipes gained through sidequests or hidden chests to heal their party and provide a stat buff, but must rest at campsites or inns to do so, similar to Final Fantasy XV, rather than cook food whenever they wish (if they have the ingredients).Saving and fast travel are no longer done at specific points on the map. Saving can be done anywhere manually, on top of two auto-save slots that are frequently overwritten. Fast travel can be done at almost any time once the player stumbles over a fast travel point on a map, except when the game story locks the function.",,,,,,,,,

Unmodified it is not suitable for ice. Requires expert mechanics for optimal build.Drag CarsDragster The Dragster is the entry level high speed car. It allows 2 parts to be added on and is weak on dirt and ice. What the car lacks in durability it makes up for in speed. Moderate mechanic required. Available by winning the Snowville GP.

Well trained mechanics needed. Upgrade to 50% to unlock the Spiral Car.Spiral Car The Spiral Car is the third variety of the dragster. Equally upgraded in all stats with an additional expansion slot.

Not suitable for dirt, but modest performance on ice. Unlockable by completing Kairo Insurance Sponsorship.The Kairo Kar is a laughably fragile vehicle that will not even survive a lap around any track without significa upgrades. Even still, it's incredibly powerful and dirt cheap. S Rank! Unlockable by winning the Kairo Island GP.Mach Car, an obvious riff on Speed Racer. Posses no real weak point save for its difficult in construction and poor performance on dirt and ice. Unlockable by upgrading both the Spiral Car and the Aero Car to 50% each. Special CharactersAdd OnsEach car will have a pre-determined number of 'slots' for tech add-ons. These add-ons will improve stats, give bonuses and features to cars that normally wouldn't have them (i.e. ice driving). All add-ons have a rank (the difficulty associated with installing them) as well as a deployment cost (the price to add to your car). Additional technology is usually available by winning races, pleasing sponsors or upgrading existing technology beyond 80%.ItemRankDescriptionCostRadial TiresDBasic tire, Bonus to Acc and Hndl.4,000Knobby TiresCImproves off-road driving14,000Studless TiresCImproves ice driving16,000Sports TiresCIncreases Hndl, Acc and bonus to on-road8,000Hi Grip TiresBIncrease Hndl16,000Slick TriesAIncrease Hndl, Acc, On-rd, negative off-rd & icy20,000V6 EngineEStarter Engine10,000V8 EngineDUnlocks by upgrading V6 80%16,000V10 EngineBUnlocks by upgrading V8 80%25,000V12 EngineAUnlocks by upgrading V10 100%40,000Seamless GearEBonus Acc6,000Speed GearCBonus Speed, Negative Acc10,000Power GearCBonus Acc, Negative Speed10,000Hi Speed GearCLarge Bonus Speed, Negative Acc17,00032 BitDIncrease qualifying race bonus9,00064 BitBIncrease qualifying race bonus13,000SuperchargerBHigher acc at low speeds12,000TurbochargerAHigher acc at low speeds15,000WingCBonus Hndl, Negative Speed8,000Big WingBBonus Hndl, Negative Speed15,000Aero BodyABonus Hnd and Dur15,000Lt ChassisCBonus Spd and Dur6,000Carbon ChassisBBonus Dur120,000Carbon BrakesBBraking increase6,000Gold EggBEarn XP faster20,000EmblemDImprove ad revenue2,000Hyper OilDBonus Spd, Acc and Hndl5,000CoatingDBonus Dur3,000Tire ChainsEImproves ice driving3,000SponsorsSponsors play a vital role in acquiring funds as well as unlocking special parts for your cars.

The game drops the players into the town of Deadhill, USA where they must use a variety of weaponry to fight off hungry zombies. Players also complete quests that correspond to the game's fantastical plot. This game includes elements of action, role playing, character levelling, crafting weapons, and challenging quests. Bright, comic-style graphics complement the zany characters and insane theme.StoryThe story begins with the town being overrun with zombies and Jack, the Gamer, being hassled by his ex-girlfriend. He even suspects he's in a videogame, and he might not even be the protagonist. Jack has to get through the day and escape the town, but he can't do it by himself. He has to join forces with his ex-girlfriend and anyone else that will help him to survive!CharactersJack, The GamerDefault prefered weapon: ShotgunUtility element: FireRachel, The GirlDefault prefered weapon: UziUtility element: SonicBrian, The GeekDefault prefered weapon: RevolverUtility element: RadiationLuxo, The AlienDefault prefered weapon: Ray GunUtility element: ShockCraftingThe game features a robust crafting system that allows the various weapons to be imbued with four different environmental modifiers, such as fire or radioactivity. Each modifier then has a different effect on a zombie, as listed below. Each modifier also has a more potent variation, unlocked later in the game, that has a stronger effect.Fire: Chance on weapon to burn a zombie, dealing extra damage for a few secondsSonic: Zombies will stand still as they're paralyzed with sound for a moment. Causes a slight increase in size.Radiation: Occasionally transforms a Zombie into a Mutant.Shock: Zombies are momentarily stunned.Health: Steals health from the zombies.The game also features a number of weapons that can be unlocked throughout the game's progression, with every weapon being able to be imbued with a modifier.ChainsawCricket BatShotgunAssault RifleUziRevolverRay GunSwordThe utility item that each character always has can also be upgraded once to a more effective version of itself. This is done in much the same manner as creating the tool the first time, with the only difference being that you use the more powerful item in the combination.SkillsEach character has four skills that can be upgraded as the player levels up. Skills require that a certain number of points be attributed to them before leveling up. Each character needs a different number of points for each skill, depending on their strengths and weaknesses. Skills may need as low as three points or as many as six to be upgraded. Five points are given upon each level earned. Characters are upgraded separately, but do not need to be leveled up individually.AttackDefenseHealthSpeedPC System RequirementsMinimum:OS: Windows XP SP3 (32 bit only)Processor: 2.0 GHzMemory: 2 GB RAMGraphics: Shader Model 3.0DirectXÂ®: 9Hard Drive: 256 MB HD spaceRecommended:OS:Windows 7Processor: 2.0 GHzMemory: 4 GB RAMGraphics: Shader Model 3.0DirectXÂ®: 9Hard Drive: 1 GB HD space",,,,,,,,,

He worked on the game in his spare time, and it was first released in late 2007. The original game included just 10 levels, and had a timer that would reset the level if it wasn't completed with the limit. Like most games released at this time, it was free.As development progressed, Labyrinth gained many features that helped boost its popularity:an accelerometer calibration menuuser-submitted level packsoptions to remove the level timeradvanced graphics and physicsAfter the increased popularity, the developers removed the full version and replaced it with a demo. They started charging a small fee to activate the demo, which only consisted of 10 demo levels. Suprisingly, this was not met with many complaints, as most fans felt that the app was well worth the price. This, however, did cause some conflict when the full Application was actually released on the iTunes Store July 25, 2008. This was due to users of the jail-broken version that paid for it having to re-buy it again from iTunes. Here's a quote from the developer on the matter:""I would very much like to make it possible to update to the App Store version from the old version but unfortunately it is not possible at the moment. I am investigating different alternatives and talking to Apple about how this can be solved.

1456410,Paper Shooter!,399,Synox Games,Synox Games,0,0,0,"Action, Indie, Simulation, Strategy, Early Access",English,,,"Overview Â A Shooter is a shooter for the Xbox Live Marketplace A shooter released on the Xbox Live Marketplace on September 24, 2010 for 80 Microsoft points, A Shooter was developed by independent studio Sorcery Games. As a traditional side-scrolling shooter in the same vein as Gradius or Scramble, A Shooter does not have much in terms of plot or gameplay depth, and is exactly what it is described as in the title. The game received mediocre reception, as most criticized the game for being too simplistic or too easy. Upon its release, Sorcery Games held a contest for those who could score the highest in the game. Players who topped the online leaderboards won a T-shirt depicting the Sorcery Games logo. Five different players won a T-shirt, with only one player actually completing A Shooter's thirteen levels. The first winner, SinedX360, was the first person to get a score on the leaderboards, differing from the other winners of the contest. Gameplay Â One item transforms enemy fire into score boosting fruit The gameplay of A Shooter is fairly simplistic, even compared to other games in the side-scrolling shooter genre. The player is on the left side of the screen, and enemies approach from the sides as the player attempts to reach the boss, progressing to the right. At the end of each of A Shooter's thirteen levels is a boss, who must be defeated in order to move on to the next stage. A Shooter also allows players to reload any level that has been reached (even if it has not been completed). As a traditional shooter, the game naturally contains a variety of power-ups and items. The power-ups mostly consist of additional lasers in other directions, aiding in destroying the more difficult enemies appearing from all sides in later levels. Bombs function differently than normal. Instead of destroying all enemies on the screen, bombs destroy lasers surrounding the player's ship. Another variety of the bomb transforms all enemy lasers into score boosting fruit. Â The game also contains an offline multiplayer component A Shooter also contains an offline multiplayer component, for up to four players. Each player appears as a differently colored and shaped ship. Player power-ups are not shared, requiring each player to collect their own items and weapon upgrades. A Shooter also has online leaderboards, as well as the offline multiplayer mode. However, unlike Xbox Live Arcade and retail Xbox 360 games, A Shooter's leaderboards only function correctly when in direct communication with a host Xbox 360, requiring multiple players to be online when a score is made (this is typically circumvented by the developer keeping a constant host Xbox 360 online and playing the game).",,,,,,,,,

It will be released for the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4 on December 14, 2021.Each match of Among Us follows a 4-15 man crew as they navigate the space base in a top-down fashion and complete tasks (as simple mini-games) to keep the crew alive. However, some members of the crew are secretly given the role of ""impostor"", whose goal instead is to murder the other crewmates undetected (as they risk being voted off, similar to other social deduction games).The game support cross-platform multiplayer between all platforms and was originally intended to be used as a multi-screen party game. While the game received limited attention on release, it received a sharp increase in popularity in 2020 following the studio's next release The Henry Stickmin Collection and the popularity of online multiplayer party games during the COVID-19 pandemic.In 2019, the game received additional bases as paid DLC (""MIRA HQ"" and ""Polus Outpost""), each introducing new cosmetic and gameplay changes. Both bases were made free on June 11, 2020, with some cosmetics available as separate DLC. A third base, ""Airship"", was released on March 31, 2021.A sequel was announced in August 2020, but was quickly cancelled a month later. Further development was put into the original game in updates, adding new quality-of-life updates such as an updated text chat system using a series of pre-set phrases (intended for console players and younger audiences). It later received an official VR spin-off in 2022, known as Among Us VR.GameplayCrewmatesThe majority of the players are Crewmates, whose goal is to either vote out all Impostor players or to complete all assigned tasks scattered throughout the base.While they cannot kill players directly, they can call a group meeting (either by discovering a dead body or by pressing a special ""emergency"" button somewhere in the map), where they discuss and perform a majority vote to determine who to jettison off the base to their death. While this is used to eliminate Impostor players, players can be deceived to eliminate Crewmate players instead.Dead crewmates, as ghosts, cannot directly interact with the other players but can help complete tasks.With the release of the November 2021 roles update, players can enable three additional ""roles"", which are given to Crewmates at random:Scientist - Can use the ""Vitals"" ability, which pulls up a tablet to check which players are dead regardless of location. This ability recharges by completing tasks.Engineer - Can use the ""Vent"" ability, which allows them to use same ventilation shafts as Impostors. This ability recharges after 30 seconds, by default.Guardian Angel - Only given to the first Crewmate that dies. Can use the ""Protect"" ability to shield a player from a Kill. This ability recharges after 60 seconds, by default.ImpostorsThe minority of the players are secretly Impostors, whose goal is to eliminate all Crewmate players (by either having them voted out or by murdering them directly).Unlike Crewmates, Impostors have special abilities that can aid them in sabotaging other players. They are given a fake list of tasks that can be used as an alibi and can traverse the base quickly by using special ventilation shafts. They can also sabotage key systems of the base, either forcing Crewmates to manage them or locking out areas.Dead impostors, as ghosts, cannot directly interact with the other players but can help sabotage.With the release of the November 2021 roles update, players can enable an additional ""role"" given to Impostors at random:Shapeshifter - Can use the ""Shift"" ability, which allows them to temporarily change their appearance into another player. This ability lasts 60 seconds and recharges after 10 seconds, by default.",,,,,,,,,

Substituting the four races of the original game for four new ones, High Elves, Dark Elves, Lizardmen, and Skaven. The new campaign is themed around the vortex of magic in the skies above the circular island of Ulthuan. The vortex has recently become unstable, but now the factions are vying to control it, stabilize it, and use it to rule the rest of the world. Default Playable RacesHigh Elves - A conceited race of elves that originally harnessed The Vortex, they inhabit the island of Ulthuan and try desperately to maintain control of The Vortex. Dark Elves - Seeking to destroy their higher counterparts, these evil elves follow Malekith as he leads them to exterminate the High Elves and conquer all that stand in their way. Lizardmen - Following their great lord Mazdamundi, the Lizardmen are among the most ancient of creatures in the world. Seeing the time is right for them to return to rule, they harness the power of dinosaurs and lasers (and sometimes lasers on dinosaurs) to wage their war to reclaim the world. Skaven - An underground empire of man-sized rats, the Skaven are a technically brilliant but unstably insane inventive race. Routinely gnawing on Warpstone, the fantasy world equivalent of radioactive uranium, in search of more power, they routinely invent machines of death and destruction that barely hold together before backfiring on their Skaven users.

They have announced that this will be playable in multiplayer and that the first title wouldn't even have to be downloaded to access this mode. They also mentioned that there were remarkably small concessions made to make the two maps stitch together well, but apart from that are completely unchanged for the combined game.",,,,,,,,,

Guided by an ever-present voice who is responsible for the player's progress, they're tasked with navigating a series of abandoned buildings on the island facility to escape; all while trying to remember how they got there in the first place.While there are first-person shooter elements to Rewind, it's not a traditional FPS. Enemy AI units who are programmed to protect the facility operate as pieces to any given area's puzzle. The curiously genial ever-present voice is tasked with helping the player understand individual core puzzle concepts through the main story and are eventually left to exercise their understanding of these concepts working simultaneously later in the campaign.Rewind is the successor to Prometheus, an Unreal Tournament 3 mod which was one of the grand final winners of 2008's Make Something Unreal Contest.GameplayRewind's gameplay is focused on cooperating with one's own self. Players must navigate through AI laser-gun wielding enemies, password protected doors, breakable glass, elevators, foot pads, and moving platforms to escape. There is a first person shooter element that uses enemies as pieces of a puzzle as opposed to being the focus of the player's objectives.The main mechanic in Rewind is, of course, rewinding time. Using this mechanic allows the player to perform, rewind, and save the actions of a clone. By doing this, the player can cooperatively solve puzzles that they couldn't otherwise. Some puzzles require the player to record over a clone that has already recorded an action. If the original action isn't replicated correctly or in a timely fashion, it can cause a paradox, which the player would need to fix by either fully rewinding and re-recording an action, or partially rewinding their current clone's actions to fix their mistake.StoryFeaturing a fully voice-acted story, Rewind's nameless protagonist wakes up in an abandoned facility that spans a completely uninhabited island. She is greeted by a jovial ever-present male voice whose responsibility it is to get the protagonist to the exit. Their conversation spans the main campaign of the game, trying to make sense of the situation they've found themselves in.ContentsRewind's main story campaign consists of seven connected facilities with seven individual puzzle areas each. There are time trials for each individual non-tutorial puzzle area. Much like other Steam releases, Rewind will feature achievements, trading cards, emotes, and backgrounds.Steam Greenlight & Steam ReleaseRewind was submitted to Steam Greenlight on September 18th, 2015; was successfully green-lit on October 9th 2015; and releases on Steam on March 31st, 2016.SoundtrackThe soundtrack for Rewind which was written by Tyler Shaw is being released alongside the base game on Steam on March 31st, 2016.

1455340,Rabi-Ribi - Orchestra Arrangement Soundtrack,1799,"CreSpirit, GemaYue",CreSpirit,0,0,0,,,,,"OverviewRabi-Ribi is a 2D exploration platformer with danmaku-style boss fights. It was originally released for the PC platform and published by Sekai Project for international audiences, and later ported to the PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, and Nintendo Switch.The game has a non-linear approach where a rabbit anthropomorph named Erina (the titular ""Rabi"") and her fairy companion Ribbon (the titular ""Ribi"") must find a way to open a gateway to another dimension to save their trapped friend. To gather the necessary magical power, the duo seek out magic-users across the world to help them out, but frequently finds themselves in battles with them due to misunderstandings.Like many exploration platformers, the game has a huge amount of power-ups and upgrades that not only make them stronger in battle but allows them to reach new areas and acquire even more upgrades. Each boss battle, and the game has many, involves dodging bullet patterns until the player can carve out a moment to counter-attack. In true bullet hell shoot 'em up style, Erina has a tiny hitbox which must be protected at all costs. ",,,,,,,,,

1455490,Deadzone: Exodus,2499,"Alexander Å½olnai, HQK Group",Alexander Å½olnai,0,0,0,"Action, Adventure",English,,,"OverviewMetro Exodus is a post-apocalypse survival-based first-person shooter and is the third entry in the Metro series. Unlike the two games before it, Metro Exodus features more of an open-world structure across several different areas.StoryFollowing the events of Metro: Last Light, Artyom becomes disillusioned with the political and social structures in the metro system and beings making regular excursions to the surface with a radio to search for outside broadcasts from other survivors. He begins hearing faint signals, but is unable to clearly receive the messages.On one such excursion, Artyom and his wife Anna witness a train traveling along a railway and are apprehended by soldiers from Hansa, one of the major metro civilizations and an adversary of the Spartan Order to which the two belong. During their escape, the two accidentally disable a radio jammer that had secretly been blocking outside broadcasts from reaching Moscow, causing a flood of messages from around the world to pour in.With the help of Yermak, himself a disillusioned Hansa resident, Artyom and Anna escape aboard the train and are nearly captured again when Colonel Miller and his Spartans intercept and save them. Miller reveals he knew about the radio jammers. According to Miller, the war that destroyed the world is still ongoing, justifying the jammers as a way to isolate and protect Moscow. The Spartans discuss returning to the metro to reveal this truth to its residents, but believing that Hansa will have them executed for what they've done, decide the only course of action is to proceed towards the Ark, where the last remnants of Russia's government is believed to be holed up.GameplayMuch like the previous two games, Metro Exodus has a strong emphasis on survival mechanics. While exploring, players must be mindful of their supply of ammunition, healing supplies, and other items like air filters and throwables.CombatIn his travels, Artyom encounters human and mutant enemies that can be engaged loudly or stealthily. Artyom carries with him a backpack that is used to change weapon attachments and to craft simple items. Every weapon in the game can be outfitted with a variety of barrels, stocks, optics, magazines, and laser sights. These are acquired by dismantling weapons found in the environment or on dead enemies. Every weapon the player picks up is permanently added to Artyom's collection back at the train. The train is the only location where the player can change their equipped weapons aside from swapping them in the field.As a weapon is used, it will begin to accumulate dirt that will eventually cause it to start jamming. Weapons can be cleaned at workbenches found throughout each region. These workbenches also allow the player to craft ammunition and are often accompanied by a bed that allows the player to sleep till day or night.Radiation is less of an issue in Metro Exodus due to it taking place outside of Moscow, but there are still areas that necessitate the use of a gas mask. The air filter on the mask must be swapped every few minutes while in use. As the player takes damage, the mask may become damaged to the point where Artyom begins to suffocate. Holes in the mask can be quick-fixed in the field using tape, limiting the player's vision. Repairing the mask proper requires a workbench.ExplorationEach region of Metro Exodus is a self-contained open world environment with locations to explore. The player can use binoculars to identify locations to be marked on the map, such as bandit camps, ruined structures for looting, and safe houses. Some of the game's regions have vehicles to facilitate travel, such as a row boat or a van, as well as ziplines to allow for a quick and safe descent from tall structures. There is a day/night cycle that affects ease of stealth and in some cases the type of enemies in the environment, as well as a dynamic weather system.ExpansionsThe Two ColonelsAfter Artyom and Colonel Miller split up in Novosibirsk, Miller sets off alone into the Metro to find a satellite map detailing the location and radioactivity of Lake Baikal. He is guided over a radio by a young boy named Kirill, the lone survivor of a devastating war that took place in the city's Metro.The Two Colonels features the boy's father, Lieutenant-Colonel Slava Khlebnikov, as the protagonist during the final year of the Novosibirsk Metro's life. Khlebnikov, an officer in the station's OSKOM military police force, directs his men on excursions deep into the Metro to burn away an invasive organic slime that periodically spreads throughout the tunnels.Meanwhile, the station has begun running low on ""green stuff,"" an anti-radiation medicine that had been sustaining the Metro's population beneath the heavily radiated ruins of Novosibirsk. OSKOM begins confiscating excess supplies of ""green stuff"" from residents, causing discontent.Unable to solve the ""green stuff"" shortage, OSKOM announces an evacuation of the Metro. At the same time, a civil war erupts between the Metro's residents and OSKOM. During the battle, Khlebnikov witnesses OSKOM General Tolya releasing poison gas into the Metro. In the ensuing confrontation, Tolya reveals that enough ""green stuff"" remains to sustain OSKOM's leadership only, and the poison gas is their attempt to mercy kill the residents on their way out.General Toyla commits suicide after learning that the evacuation has left without him, and Khlebnikov survives the battle. Disillusioned with OSKOM and determined to save his son, he sets out into a bunker in the city ruins to find a the satellite map of Lake Baikal. He successfully retrieves the map, but succumbs to radiation poisoning shortly thereafter.One month later, Colonel Miller, having followed Khlebnikov's journey, finds the colonel's body and retrieves the map.Sam's StoryFollowing the end of Metro Exodus, the American member of the Spartans, Samuel Taylor, decides to leave the crew to pursue his dream of finding passage back to the United States to reunite with his father. He sets out alone in the crew's van and reaches Vladivostok.On the outskirts of Vladivostok, Sam encounters a Captain named Eduard Baranov, who points Sam to an operational nuclear submarine sitting in the harbor. Baranov was the commander of the submarine during the war that destroyed the world, and explains that he never allowed any of its missiles to fire.Sam is shortly thereafter captured by some men who take him to the submarine, where he meets another American named Tom. Tom has a plan to refuel the submarine and use its nuclear arsenal as power projection, promising to take Sam to San Diego if he helps accomplish this task.Sam ventures out into the ruins of Vladivostok with the help of Captain Baranov. The two are eventually successful in retrieving the fuel rods needed to power the submarine. On the way back, Baranov reveals that the fuel rods have a built-in self-destruct mechanism designed to eliminate any chance of the submarine being captured, and asks Artyom to consider detonating the charges to prevent Tom from having access to the craft's intact arsenal.Upon returning to the submarine, one of Tom's former subordinates, Krim, launches an attack. Krim had grown disillusioned with Tom's philosophy of power projection, believing instead that the nuclear weapons on board should be used offensively right away. Sam helps put down the attack as Tom and Captain Baranov sail out into the harbor.Depending on the player's choice, Sam can either board the submarine and travel to the United States, or detonate the fuel rods and sink it.Enhanced EditionMetro Exodus Enhanced Edition, free to all owners of the original game, was released for PC on May 6, 2021.

1455510,Dragon's Hoard,,,,0,0,0,,,,,"OverviewCombining elements of a real-time strategy game with those of a dual-stick shooter, Hoard gives the player control a dragon out to hoard the largest pile of gold. Each dragon has the ability to breathe fire, fly and perform several special abilities by collecting power-ups.Â Map  Gold is earned in several ways, mostly by killing merchant wagons or destroying buildings but also by picking up treasure chests that appear. Dragons have a limited carrying capacity and must return to their hoard to deposit the gold they have. Destroying crops and other resources will have an effect on the kingdom, causing its inhabitants to prosper or decline, which in turn effects the player's access to gold and their final score. Dragons can also acquire gold by kidnapping princesses, scarring tribute from villages or stealing from the hoard piles of other dragons.There is a rudimentary levelling system in the game tied to the collection of gold. Once certain amounts of gold have been deposited in hoard the player will level up. This will unlock upgrade points that can be used in one of four abilities: fire breath, speed, carrying capacity and armour. Putting points into one of these categories will improve your dragon's performance and adds another layer of strategy to the game.Hoard includes both competitive and co-operative mulitplayer with up to four players.Game ModesTreasureThe goal of this mode is to collect as much treasure as possible in 10 minutes.Princess RushThe goal of this mode is to be the first dragon to ransom fifteen princesses.HoardThe goal of this mode is to simply stay alive as long as possible. You have no hoard, and gold that you pick up is instantly counted toward an automatic upgrade that gives your dragon better armor, speed, and fire breath.Co-opThis mode works just like Treasure, except that multiple dragons share one hoard and work together to build it up.UpgradingAs you drop gold at your hoard, certain gold intervals allow you to invest upgrade points in your dragon's stats. You can upgrade your dragon in 4 ways:SpeedUpgrades how quickly your dragon can fly.Fire BreathUpgrades how long you can breath fire and how much damage the breath does.CarryUpgrades how much gold your dragon can carry and how fast your dragon drops off gold.ArmourUpgrades how much damage your dragon can take before having to return to your hoard.Note: your dragon's appearance will change depending on how you upgrade it.Objects/EnemiesImmediately after a game is started in any mode, the human kingdom will begin to develop. The civilization's structures and units are as follows:NameNotesImageMill / farmMills produce farms and carts at a regular rate. Each farm is worth 100 gold when destroyed, but adds value to carts that leave the mill.Â PC System RequirementsOperating System: Windows XP or BetterProcessor: Dual Core 2GhzRAM Memory: 2GBHard Disk Space: 625 MBVideo Card: ATI Radeon X800 XL or betterSound Card: Supports OpenAL 1.1 or betterAdditional: Requires OpenGL 2.0 support or better.

Players take on the role of the Navigator (named in-game by the player), who must recruit a team of characters and ""attack"" by drawing lines across connected color squares on the battlefield, to eliminate enemies and progress through the game.StoryThe game takes place on the world of Astra, where The Navigator, one of the last remaining Caelestites alive, is inadvertently rescued by a team of Aurorians. The Navigator uses telepathy to guide the Aurorians out of danger and onto a path that efficiently allows them to defeat their enemies, the Eclipsites. With the Aurorians help, The Navigator manages to get their Colossus skyworthy again, but soon finds themselves drawn into a conflict between various factions of Aurorians and the Eclipsites, who are joined by a traitor who sold out her fellow Caelestites for power.GameplayThe player directs a team of up to five Aurorians spanning up to four different element, each with a pair of skills: one that can be triggered actively between turns, and one that can be triggered after stringing together a Chain Combo. Each round, the player must find a way to string together Chain Combos by plotting a path for their character across adjacent tiles. If the path runs directly by enemies, the squad Captain and any Aurorians matching the tile color element will perform a normal attack on the enemy. After finishing their move, the active Aurorians on that turn will unleash their Chain Combo skill if conditions have been met.In-between turns, the player can switch the Captain of the team up to 3 times, allowing them to take advantage of another Aurorian's Chain Combo skill without worry about an elemental mismatch. The player wins the stage if they eliminate all enemies, though some stages may have different victory conditions, such as landing their party on a specific tile to escape, or surviving an unlimited wave of enemies for a certain amount of turns. The player loses the stage if their party's HP is reduced to 0, or they run out of available turns.AuroriansThe playable characters in the game, most Aurorians fall under one of four elemental affinities, and one of four classes. Players must mix and match their team to play to the strengths of both the map and the enemies being faced. Aurorians can be upgraded with ""Jasper"" to increase their level. When they reach their maximum level, they can be further upgraded through Ascension, using certain resources to reset their level but give them greater stats and a passive ability through their unique Equipment, which itself can be upgraded.ElementsAurorians are either:FireForestLightningWaterUsing an element with an advantage (Fire > Forest > Lightning > Water > Fire) will deal 120% of normal damage to the opponent. Likewise, using an element with a disadvantage will result in only 80% of normal damage to the opponent.At maximum Ascension, a high-rarity Aurorian may gain a second elemental trait allowing them to attack when drawing a path on that color, but their attack will be much weaker for that round.ClassesThere are four main classes that Aurorians fall into.Sniper: Their abilities allow them to target enemies anywhere on the field, from long distance.Converter: Converts other tiles to ones that match their element.Support: Healers and buffers who provide utility to their team outside of raw attack power.Detonator: Powerful AOE damage-dealers that can blow up enemies around them or on a specified grid.",,,,,,,,,

Utilizing a revamped version of the Renegade Kid Engine and more intuitive controls, it has been universally hailed as one of the best of its kind on the Nintendo DS. A remake of the game, titled Moon Chronicles, is set to be released throughout 2014 in episodic format on the Nintendo 3DS eShop.StoryMajor Kane; the protagonist.The year is 2058; researchers have been secretly working on a lunar base for some time. While exploring the surface, these researchers find a sealed alien hatch and from there on in are caught in numerous violent encounters with extraterrestrials.Shortly after landing there with an unspecified objective his team is attacked and numerous marines are kidnapped. The protagonist, Major Kane, has no choice but to go into the sealed alien hatch in the hopes of finding his comrades.Just like in Metroid Prime: Hunters, much of the storytelling in Moon is told through exploring environments and reading digital diary entries. The game also features a few 3D cutscenes with voice acting, running on a 3D engine.GameplayMoon's controversial control scheme utilizes both the D-pad (for movement), touch screen (for aiming and selecting weapons) and shoulder buttons (shooting). While it is inherently accurate, some find it uncomfortable to use.Moon hearkens back to the FPSs of old, such as Doom or Quake. It is less action-oriented, with a small number of enemies on screen at any time, and focuses on adventure elements and story progression.ReceptionMoon's critical and fan reception has been mixed. Holding a 74 Metascore, Moon was widely received as one of the best FPSs on the DS -- largely thanks to the lack of competition. Critics complained about repeating level design and derivative narrative. Some loved it, however, and it won an Editor's Choice award at IGN.com and Worth Playing.

1453870,Flow,0,Flow ehf,Flow ehf,0,0,0,"Free to Play, Indie, Simulation",English,,,"OverviewflOw started out as a free flash game available online in which the player takes control of an aquatic, worm-like creature, which is controlled via the mouse. The basic mechanic of the game is to 'eat' other organisms that inhabit the environment, which causes the player's creature to grow or evolve. The creatures also have special abilities controlled by the left mouse button.The PlayStation 3 version of flOw is largely the same as the flash version, but it expands the scope of the gameplay by offering more playable creatures and SIXAXIS motion control.On October 10, 2009, a trophy patch was implemented.GameplayflOw is a game in which uses the sixaxis function of the DualShock 3 controller. You control these cellular lifeforms and eat other cells floating around the screen to make your creature grow. Throughout the game, you will take part in six different campaigns, and use your creature to go through portals to advance through different layers in the campaign. You can go through the campaign with or without eating any other cells, which will make your creature remain the same size and be more vulnerable. Also eating creatures or cells will help your creature grow, but either creatures bigger than you can also eat cells growing off your creature. The basic goal is to get to the end of the campaign with all of the creatures, and eventually getting to the credits screen, thus beating the game of flOw.Structure (Flash/PC version)The PC version features two playable creatures, these creatures, the 'snake' and the 'jellyfish' are also the first two playable creatures in the PS3 version (see below).Structure (PS3 version)flOw is loosely based around the idea of levels, but the implementation is quite far from the norm. The player can move 'up' or 'down,' in terms of depth, by eating special blue or red organisms respectively. At each level of depth, there are different organisms, some of which can be hostile. Engaging hostile creatures is never explicitly mandatory for progressing to the next level, but survival at the deeper, more difficult levels, is greatly aided by having previously advanced your creature by eating enough organisms to make it evolve.Playable CreaturesThere are 5 playable creatures in the main version of flOw, and an extra playable creature in the add-on pack.First Creature - 'Snake'The first creature in flOwThe first playable creature is snake like in appearance, growing longer as it consume more organisms. Its unique ability is a speed boost. It can increase its length, and can also develop wing-like appendages on its sides by eating certain organisms.Second Creature - 'Jellyfish'The second playable creature is round and jellyfish like. Its normal movement is fairly slow, but its special ability, a spinning maneuver that sucks in nearby organisms, allows it to build up momentum. After using its special ability, it is able to briefly move faster.Third Creature - 'Dolphin'The third playable creature has a body which loosely resembles the shape of a dolphin, but gains a long tail similar to the snake creature as it develops.Fourth Creature - 'Stealth Snake'The fourth playable creature is similar to the firs. However, its special ability is to cloak itself, and to paralyze other organisms.Fifth Creature - 'Predator Snake'The fifth playable creature is another snake like one. This one, however, it develops more aggressive looking body parts, and has the special ability to lock on other organisms and to make a sharp dash towards it, making it very easy to attack other creatures.Sixth Creature - 'Credit Snake'The sixth playable creature is yet another snake. This is the simplest of the six, as it simply grows longer with each bit of food it eats, and only has a small boost ability. The only time this creature is playable is during the credits of the game, in which the player consumes a piece of food attached to each credit.Seventh Creature - 'Bubble Boy'The seventh playable creature was added in expansion pack released for the game. This creature has the appearance of a small blob surrounded by several sections of hard shell each attached to the body of the creature by tendrils. The creature's special ability is to draw this portions of its body inward, creating a shell, granting the player temporary invulnerability.",,,,,,,,,

All this is done by using laparoscopic devices in-game that resemble those used by surgeons in real life.The game will support a unique controller based developed by Pezy on real laparoscopic equipment but utilizing two Wii Remotes and Nunchuks that act like laparoscopic graspers and a base plate resembling two trocar sites. According to developer Grendel Games, this will âsubconsciously train [the player's] basic laparoscopic skills, such as depth perception, eye-hand coordination, inverse movements and bi-manual dexterity.â Alternatively, the analog sticks on the Wii U GamePad can be used to control the game, if one does not wish to purchase the special controller.Underground will release as a Wii U eShop title and cost between â¬20-30 and the controller is said to be offered at an affordable price point far below that of typical learning tool equivalents (normally valued at about â¬200). Details for how to obtain the special control device have not been announced, neither has a release date.",,,,,,,,,

1452450,Fantasy Grounds - Pathfinder RPG - Campaign Setting: Distant Worlds,1999,"SmiteWorks USA, LLC",,0,0,0,"Indie, RPG, Strategy",English,,,"OverviewDistant Worlds is a pausable, real-time 4X space strategy game. The game features a large variety of different systems: combat, research, building, ship designs, and other areas.Unlike most 4X games, DW has many automation options, almost allowing the game to play itself save for decision making and diplomacy. This allows the player to learn the games different systems individually, easing the steep learning curve. The player can choose to control (or automate) ship building, ship design, diplomacy, military actions, trade, colonisation and research.DW also separates empire management between the State and Private sectors. State sector objects include military ships, fleets and planets and Private sector ships include trade station, and freight ships. The Private sector is completely automated.The player can achieve victory in many ways. Aside from basic 4x objectives (such as controlling a large percentage of the map, or having a set percentage of the galaxy's population/trade/research) each race has a race specific objective that allows them to strive for the completion of a task that best suits the strengths of their chosen species.Like the Civilization series the game has an in-game editor, which can be switched to at any time, as well as a Galacticopedia, featuring a deep set of tutorials and explanations for the game mechanics, and almost everything present in the game, such as planet types, weaponry and government types.The game is 2D top-down, and uses a mix of sprites and vector/drawn art. It is highly moddable, using .txt and .jpgs for much of the game. ExpansionsDW has 4 expansions so far:Return of the Shakturi (16 Dec 2010) - which added new ship types, redid the tech system and adding more techs, it improved the UI and Fleet system, and added in windowed support along with other minor tweaks.Legends (23 Nov 2011) - which improved how characters (Admirals, Generals, Agents, Etc.) worked and improved the AI, Diplomacy and Fleet systems; it also increased support for modding the game and added more to the tech tree.Shadows (23 May 2013) - this added in the ability to play as Pirates, added in an alternate start time when empires are weaker, and improved AI, game performance, the graphics engine, and in general extended and improved the Ground combat and tech tree for it.Universe (23 May 2014) - the latest expansion, which also includes the base game and all previous expansions added modding and customization support along with a new official storyline. It also marked the first time the game was available on Steam and saw the game receive a significant price deduction. Significant effort went into expanding to modding capabilities of the game engine. The game comes with example mods that can be activated and deactivated at any time. GameplayThe game plays like most 4X games: a main view where you look and keep track of your empire with it, the mini-map and a list, with Research and Management opening in pop-up/separate windows.Starting a new game is more in-depth than most other 4X's, with the player being able to define Galaxy Age, Pirate Intensity and other specific options; this also includes defining how victory can be achieved, with the percentage of the basic objectives (% of Galaxy controlled,% of total Trade controlled and others) needed, as well as percentage of the Race-specific objectives needed. State and Private EmpireThis is where DW simplifies expanding the infrastructure of your empire: instead of manually setting orders to direct trade at this system, a group of private traders will go and automatically trade what they can, instead of having to transport people or goods, private ships will do so automatically.The main difference between the two is that the Private side purchases ships and designs from the State, who run colonies, military vessels, and space bases; the Private side can also build extractors and refineries of their own, running goods transports for the State anyway.Automation options also allows for the State side to be run automatically. Empire ManagementMuch like other 4X games the game allows the player to get a simple look at how his empire is doing through a basic management screen, with options for detailed explanations. ResearchDivided into 3 separate sectors: Weapons tech, Defensive tech and General Empire Tech; each sector researches an item at once, with the tech tree being much like Galactic Civilizations II in terms of layout. Ship DesignDifferent to other space 4X's this works by choosing the ship role, the ship image used, and then picking the components in it, with no need to worry over tile placement, instead having to consider mass, energy power and the limits of what the ship can do.As part of the automation options, the player can set the game to take control over ship design entirely, or take over retrofitting and upgrading, or take control of specific ship designs. Space and Planet CombatSpace combat is very simple in that it has ships fire their weapons and does a runthrough of checks and equations to see how much damage has been done.Planet combat is different to other games in that the defenders must have brought or trained troops of their own to defend a colony, save for the militia, and the attackers bring their troops, leading to a smashing of the two forces to see who wins. Other forms of planetary combat include attacking with ship weaponry, as well as the standard nuking being an option.

It was first released in early access on Steam in February 2017, before a final version of the game was released on July 30 2019. Klei has announced plans for additional downloadable content for the game since release.Players are tasked with managing a colony of duplicants as they try to build a space colony inside a randomly generated asteroid. The player takes indirect control of the colony by designating tasks for the duplicants, like mining, growing food, researching and building, and assigning them a priority.Success requires careful management of oxygen, water, food and heat in order to keep the colony alive. Players will also need to manage the well being of their duplicants by keeping their stress levels low, and preventing the spread of infection diseases throughout the colony.Duplicants will be better suited to different tasks depending on their stats and attributes. Skills determine what the duplicants are good at, and how quickly they'll learn. While attributes can be positive or negative and may increase a duplicants burden on the colony.ONI simulates the dispersion of heat and liquids, and diffusion of gases.The game takes inspiration from Dwarf Fortress, Rimworld and The Sims.",,,,,,,,,

With ties to a budding revolution, the housekeeper slowly earns the trust and respect of her boss, and as the insurgency starts to gain a foothold, both the player and the unseen boss begin an uneasy back-and-forth alliance and friendship.Each day within the game, the player is given daily chores to do, like sweeping, mopping, changing clothes, or later, trying to keep the house in order as the owner desperately tries to stop the widespread destruction of art within the city.

It also received a limited-edition retail release by Limited Run. The online servers were later shut down on September 14, 2018.The first game by Boss Key (founded by former Epic design director Cliff Bleszinski and former Guerrilla director Arjan Brussee), Lawbreakers was a team-based arena shooter, set in a post-apocalyptic sci-fi world, with a unique class-based system (called ""Roles"", where character selection is tied to both the Role and the team) and a focus on special movement abilities.After the dissolution of Boss Key, the PC version of the game became free-to-play on June 11, 2018 (with all in-game purchases disabled) prior to closure of both PS4 and PC servers.GameplayTeam-based shooter with multiple modes:OverchargeA Capture the Flag-style mode with one ""Battery"" acting as the flag. Teams must race to carry a neutral battery to their base and protect it for 20 seconds after it hits 100% charge to get a point for their side. However, a stolen battery will retain the charge it had before being removed, which means even a losing team can still claim a point if they take and secure the battery from the enemy's base at 99%. The first team to 3 points wins.UplinkSimilar to Overcharge, except the flag is a satellite dish. The charge retained is not tied to the dish, but to the team's own upload percentage.Turf WarA territory control style mode in which teams must lock down up to three vital locations on the map per round. When all three points are controlled, the points will be added to the total of the team controlling each one, and the points reset to neutral control 15 seconds later. The game continues until one team hits the maximum number of points.BlitzballTwo teams must race to take the ""E.U.R.O. Ball"" (the Blitzball, voiced by Justin Roiland) from the middle of the map and run it into their enemy's base, all the while listening to the ball complement or insult them depending on their performance. However, if they take too long, the ball will explode and take the carrier with it.OccupyA King of the Hill-style mode where one team must occupy a single victory point on the map, earning points for maintaining their occupation and for defending it against incoming enemies. The point itself shifts around the map every 45 seconds. The first team to reach 200 points wins.Team DeathmatchA separate mode with no objectives other than to rack up the most enemy kills as a team, either hitting the maximum number of kills or the most after 20 minutes of play.Character RolesVanguardA front-line fighter equipped with a flight suit that can jet around the battlefield and strike at the enemy from any range.Maverick (Law)Member of the Valkyries.

Player characters move left and right and can shoot only straight up - which isnât that much of a problem since most enemies spend most of their time in the air.The game features almost 150 short levels in the Campaign mode (including boss levels and optional side levels) as well as 9 levels in the Endless mode.All game modes can be played with either one or two players using local coop.PlotIn a fantasy world a Brotherhood of Knights is led by the Captain and his two commanders. They use a mysterious arcane power, which gives them access to guns, to wage wars against the enemies of the kingdom they serve.During a battle in the capital city the Captain betrays and kills the entire order taking most of the power for himself. His two commanders survive and embark on a journey throughout the world to find their former lord and defeat him. On the way they are helped by the Wanderer, a mysterious man who runs the ingame shop.Game modesKnights and Guns has two main game modes: Campaign and Endless.The CampaignThere are close to 150 levels on the grid-based world map in the âCampaignâ game mode. The players begin on one end of the map and they unlock levels as they move forward.The map is divided into 12 acts, each consisting of 9 levels placed on a 3x3 grid - the players can choose his or her path through and skip some levels he or she wants to avoid.Between the acts are the âportalâ levels in which the players fight a boss or some mini-bosses.On the edges of the map the players will find side levels, which are optional.LevelsEach level has an unique background (with about â of the levels having an original background and â being modified versions of the previous backgrounds).Each level has an objective: kill all enemies, survive for a set amount of time or destroy special crystal enemies within a time limit.Beating a level gets the players a reward of gold.Each level has a set of available weapons assigned to it. At least one of them is always free, and others can be purchased and thus permanently unlocked for that level.Beating a level multiple times with different weapons gives the players golden bullets for that level - after getting 3 of those (or 1 or 2 if the level has less than 3 weapons) the background of the level can be viewed without launching the level.Map objectsSome fields on the map may contain objects and items which can be interacted with.Chests. They can contain gold, lives or armor fragments. They require a key to open.Keys for the chests.Gates: can be opened with gold or by beating the required amount of levels. (Depending on the gate.)Scrolls: contain a picture revealing some of the worldâs history.Gates have to be opened before the level can be accessed.Other items can be picked up after the level has been beaten.EndlessThis game mode allows for continuous play on one of the 9 special levels. Monsters wonât stop spawning and only when the players are dead does the game stop.A highscore for each level is kept - individually for each of the available weapons. Passing certain score thresholds also awards the players with a trophy - bronze, silver or gold.Endless levels are unlocked with gold. Other than that there are no restrictions - this mode can be played regardless of the progress in the Campaign.Meta-gameThe store and goldGold is the main currency in the game.Itâs gained by completing levels, from chests and collected during gameplay itself.It is spent on opening gates on the campaign map and, most importantly, in the store.Consumables: extra lives, full special attack gauge and golden keys for opening golden chests.Armor: new armor for the knights. They change how the characters look and increase their stats. The players unlock new sets of armor by completing acts - then they can be purchased with gold and equipped.Gossip: The only thing players can get in the store for free - the shopkeeper can give them some vague information on various topics.Scrolls: scrolls collected from the world map as well as all the video cutscenes players have seen so far - all of which can be viewed again here.Books: appear in the store for completing acts or found in chests, can be bought with gold. They contain art and names of the enemies.Music: unlocked for completing acts and bought with gold. The players can listen to the entirety of the gameâs soundtrack here.Hall of FameA Hall of Fame with achievements and all kinds of stats can be accessed from the main menu.GameplayPlayer characters can:Move left and right, jump.Dash, moving fast and dealing damage to the enemies. It costs Energy.Shoot.Use the Special Attack. It requires the special attack gauge to be full - players do that by killing enemies.Touching enemies or their projectiles damages player characters. If health drops to 0, the character dies. It can be revived if the players have any extra lives (which can be bought in the store or found in chests on the world map). If thatâs not the case and both players are dead, the level ends in failure.Aside from the monsters the levels might also contain:Platforms.Portals.Traps: Retractable spikes.Cannons and rocket launcher turrets.Stalactites, icicles or spiked metal blocks - all of which fall down on the player when he or she is under them.Pools of acid.Various items can be gathered from the defeated foes:Gold.

And with each phase the Captain becomes more and more dangerous, gaining access to faster and stronger attacks.PresentationThe game uses hand-drawn, comic book style, 2D art for most of its art.Some in-game animations are drawn frame by frame while others use 2D rigging and move/scale sprites.Light sources and particle effects from the Unity Engine are also used throughout the game.

1451540,Blade Flash Death,,,,0,0,0,,,,,"Similar to Konami's 2001 arcade game Blade of Honor, the game could accurately detect the player's hand gestures using electromagnetic tracker technology, which worked in a similar manner to the Wii's accelerometer technology. Mazan's virtual katana blade matched the player's movements precisely.The arcade machine was released in Japan, the United States, and United Kingdom. However, the game's electromagnetic tracker technology was too expensive and required significant floor space, so it was not as widely available in the US or UK outside of the larger arcades.Arcade hardwareThe game's arcade machine, based on the Sega Naomi hardware, used expensive electromagnetic tracker technology for the accurate motion-sensing technology. Namco produced their own custom GPU cards in order to provide enough power to run the unit. Each custom GPU card was capable of 1.4 GigaFLOPS, and up to 16 could be inserted into the unit, where they would automatically function as a multi-core system. With 3 GB of EPROM on each card, they could be assigned dedicated tasks, such as monitoring the electromagnetic trackers in real-time.

The game features a free-to-play model with microtransactions in the form of Hero Tokens and Isotope-8, both of which can be used to recruit new superheroes to the player's team (and to buy a slot to use the recruit), level up powers and characters.Marvel Puzzle Quest features a short single player campaign and asynchronous player-vs-player combat. If the player is defeated or heroes are ""downed"" mid-battle, they can be healed outside of battle with a health pack or by waiting for them to revive on their own. Other in-game events are held based on the events on the Dark Reign storyline and are used as opportunities for public quests and sales for the game's two currencies.GameplayHawkeye is attacking because gems with his icon have been matched.Similar to the original Puzzle Quest, Marvel Puzzle Quest is a Match-3 style game where the player matches colored gems to perform attacks. However, instead of controlling one character, the player can control three superheroes in a battle and fight up to a team of three opponents. Instead of collecting gems for spells, superhero powers can be used (with the appropriate gem collected) with effects ranging from damage to stunning the opponent for a number of turns.New for this version of Puzzle Quest is icons depicting heroes on the gems, determining which hero will swap in for an attack and will stay as the lead while the opponent deals damage. For example, matching three red lightning bolt gems will have Storm attack, just as three green lightning bolt gems, or three yellow lightning bolt gems will. The board gems' icons change depending on the superheroes used, adding another layer of strategy.In battles against opponents with multiple characters on the opposite team, the player can choose which enemy to target by tapping/clicking on the opponent's picture at the top of the screen. Downed opponents/heroes cannot use their abilities for the remainder of the battle.Environmental tiles also play a part in the game's strategy. Not bound by character and colorless, these tiles don't deal damage but fill up a meter for a special ability when matched. One of these is the ""Hot Dog Stand"" which heals all players on a team.System RequirementsMinimumOS: Windows XP SP3CPU: Intel Pentium 4 3.00GHz or betterRAM: 1 GBGPU: Intel HD 3000 / Nvidia GeForce 8600 GT / ATI Radeon HD 4650DirectX: Version 9.0cNetwork: Broadband Internet connectionSound Card: Windows Compatible CardFree Disk Space: 250 MB",,,,,,,,,

Every squid has his/her own stats and special abilities in addition to this various items, which are found within the stages or bought in the game's shop, can be equipped in order to increase the aforementioned stats.These stats include :LevelHealthStaminaAttackDefenseSpecial ability (Dash, Heal)There are 4 different kinds of squids each with their own special ability:Shooter: Possesses the ability to shoot bubble projectiles at enemies.Trooper: While slow and less agile than the other classes, the trooper has high attack rates and can summon a tidal wave.Scout: The quickest and most maneuverable, is the game's jack-of-all-trades class having medium attack and defense rates.Healer: Most of the healer's stats are slightly below average, however the healer's special skill more then makes up for this. Any contact with another squid will regenerate their health.During stages the player can collect 3 stars:Secret: Hidden in the stage.Survival: All Squids must make it to the end of the level.Speed: Complete the level within a certain number of rounds.There are a few squids to chose from when preparing for battle:Steev: As a scout class squid, he is quite maneuverable and has far reach. For all intents and purposes Steev is Squids' main character.Vahine: A mild-mannered female healer squid.Winnick: An elder squid with immense power that is only with the group for the initial few battles.Clint: Clint is a red elderly shooter squid that's already survived one war with the black ooze. He's basically Clint Eastwood in squid form. When unlocked the ""the Unforgiven"" achievement pops.Sammo: Sammo is a stout Trooper squid, able to project devastating tidal waves. He also loves food and treasure. He is named for notably overweight action star Sammo Hung.Vesper: A blue female shooter squid with a somber attitude. She is part of Thalas Guards and is named for Vesper Lynd, an early James Bond love interest.Venus: A relaxed and beautiful healer. Also part of Thalas Guards.There are two kinds of stages in Squids: The survival variant, in which the player must clear a couple waves of enemies and the exploration stages which have the player getting to a certain part of the map whilst staving off opponents. Within both areas the player can collect power ups (safety shells that protect the user from damage and being pushed off the edge of the map by adversaries, food that recharges stamina and health, attack buffs, etc) hang onto anchors to minimize damage and prevent being pushed off the map, use currents to traverse the map more efficiently (more common in exploration stages) and open treasure chests filled with items or pearls.Pearls, the game's currency, can be obtained through various means.When enemies are killed they tend to drop pearlsTreasure chestsCombosMicrotransactionsThey can be spent in the game's store on hats, buffs, level ups or even additional squids.HatsVarious equippable hats and helmets can be found scattered throughout the games stages. Along with adding some visual flair they provide stats bonuses to each squid. Once found they have to be bought in the game's store. Their stats can be permanently transferred to the squids, allowing the player to wear whichever hat they prefer.ClassHelmetHealthStaminaAttackDefenseDashHealStompShootScoutCapsule10110000ScoutStrawcap20010000ScoutBoxing hat00001000ScoutTiki Mask40040000ScoutLegion50520000ScoutDevil00420000ScoutBeer80220000ScoutS-Lantern50010000ScoutHockey Mask05220000MedicHeadband10010000MedicNacre Crown60300000MedicMedusa60350000MedicTiara30420000MedicWonder30240000MedicM-Lantern20020000MedicWitch Hat25210000ShooterRedemption70540000ShooterHermes40320000ShooterClaw Crown30230000ShooterStetson10010000ShooterBonaparte40220000ShooterSh-Lantern30110000ShooterVampire10120002TrooperCupidon80550000TrooperStrainer60440000TrooperFool010200000TrooperRice pot50010000TrooperStrawhat10110000TrooperFrankenstein20210020ArtOne could liken Squids art style to that of Rayman Origins.

It was developed by Terminal Reality for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC; and Red Fly Studio for the PlayStation 2, Nintendo Wii, and Nintendo DS versions. The PS2/Wii version of the game has a graphical style notably distinct from other versions, featuring character designs stylistically similar to a Pixar motion picture or Team Fortress 2.Ghostbusters: The Video Game was released June 16th, 2009, alongside the release of the original Ghostbusters on Blu-ray, to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the movie. In Europe and other PAL regions, the game is to be a timed PlayStation exclusive, published by SCEE. However, Atari confirmed that the North American Xbox 360 version is to be region free, meaning Europeans with Xbox 360s can import the game.If you pre-ordered the game at Gamestop you received a Ghostbusters T-shirt and a downloadable in game 'flight suit'.A demo was released for the game on the PlayStation Network on July 9, 2009.StoryAn example of artwork from the PS2/Wii version of Ghostbusters: The Video GameThe game's story was written by Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis, who played Ray Stanz and Egon Spengler respectively and co-created the Ghostbusters series. Aykroyd has gone on-record as saying that the game is, effectively, Ghostbusters III. Many of the key cast members from the films reprised their roles in likeness and in voice. One notable exception to this is Rick Moranis who refused to come out of retirement to reprise his role as accountant Louis Tully. As a result, Louis is said to be on vacation during the events of the story. Sigourney Weaver also refused to be a part of the game because she did not feel that the script lived up to the two movies. She later changed her mind and said that it was a worthy follow up, but by then it was impossible to write her into the game.The game puts players in the role of a new recruit to the Ghostbusters team, just as Manhattan is overrun with supernatural monsters. Players are given several weapons, including one that allows the player to manipulate objects by shooting them with sticky slime tethers and anchoring them to the level geometry. Some key villains that return from the movies are the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man, the librarian and Gozer. GameplayGhost wrangling!Ghostbusters: The Video Game is played from a third person perspective with movement and aiming behaving similar to a third person shooter , the basic equipment players start with consists of the Proton Pack, Ecto Goggles (called Paragoggles in the game), Ghost Trap and P.K.E Meter.Ghostbusting basically revolves around first weakning Ghosts with the Proton Pack stream (this will turn into a capture beam after the player has taken enough ""health"" out of ghosts) and then using the Ghost Traps to capture them for good.The Proton pack has four different modes, each featuring alternate firing modes themselves; with the default mode turning into an explosive blast called a boson dart, a shock blast mode with stasis, a rapid firing mode with homing properties and the fourth shooting a stream of green goo with tethering capabilities (the latter being used mostly to solve puzzles). There is also an overheating mechanic where your pack will overheat after firing for a long time, and it will not work for a few seconds (players can press a button to vent off the pack releasing the heat manually); there is a temperature meter on the back of the pack so players can keep track of things.The P.K.E meterThe P.K.E Meter is used in combination with the googles (this changes the game to a first person perspective) to track ectoplasmic activity and P.K. energy. It also serves as a ghost scanner, keeping track of Ghost types and their weaknesses.Players will receive money for capturing ghosts and completing missions, although the more damage they cause (destroying places and objects for exemple) the more money is deducted from the final payment. The money can be spent on various upgrades such as a slam-dunk ability to trap ghosts faster, better scanning etc.When players run out of health they will go down, but can be revived by the other members of the Team (AI can also go down and be revived as well). Health regenerates automatically by not taking damage for a while. If all squad members go down, the game will restart from the last checkpoint. Multiplayer (Co-Op)Egon, in the PS3 / Xbox 360 VersionIn the HD version's online-only co-op multiplayer, players work together to bust ghosts within a time limit. Unfortunately you cannot play the story online or any form of co-op. The co-op here takes place in areas seen in the single-player game.The game offers several modes:Instant Action: Players can test their mettle in a variety of Job Types across a selection of 12 different maps to see if they've got what it takes to be a true Ghostbuster.Survival: Survive a paranormal onslaughtContainment: Capture all the ghostsDestruction: Eliminate mysterious artifacts to prevent spawning ghostsProtection: Protect Egon's devicesThief: Save the artifacts from being stolen by ghostsSlime Dunk: Dunk the most SlimersSD VersionThe Standard Definition versions of Ghostbusters the Video Game (Wii, PS2, and PSP) share the same overall story as the HD version, but with a radically changed art style and level designs. The player still plays the role of the Rookie, but can now select the Rookie's sex at the start of the game. The game has the same level progression, but each level has been completely redesigned. The New York Streets portion of level 2 was removed, and the architectural office was replaced with a game design studio, complete with electronic sprite ghosts. The fight against a possessed Alyssa in the Museum was replaced with a fight against a skeletal T-Rex. The Collector was changed from a knight in armor to a massive toothy worm, and the Black Widow changed from a thin white woman to a heavyset black woman.Gameplay-wise the slamming mechanics of the HD version were removed, and instead trapping a ghost requires the player to follow a set of directional prompts displayed onscreen. The game has no currency or upgrade system, but completing 50% and 100% of the Spirit Guide will both reward health boosts. As a bonus, and on the Wii version only, it is possible to play the game's entire story mode in co-op.System RequirementsMinimum System RequirementsOS: Windows XP/VistaProcessor: Any Intel or AMD Dual CoreMemory: 2 GBHard Drive: 9 GB FreeVideo Memory: 512 MB (nVidia GeForce 8400/ATI Radeon X1300)Sound Card: DirectX CompatibleDirectX: 9.0cKeyboard & MouseDVD Rom DriveRecommended System RequirementsOS: Windows XP/VistaProcessor: Any Intel or AMD Dual CoreMemory: 2 GBHard Drive: 9 GB FreeVideo Memory: 512 MB (nVidia GeForce 8800/ATI Radeon HD2900)Sound Card: DirectX CompatibleDirectX: 9.0c or 10Keyboard & MouseDVD Rom DriveXbox 360 controller",,,,,,,,,

It was later released for the Xbox One (on June 26, 2015), PlayStation 4 (on June 16, 2015), Linux (via Steam on March 21, 2016), and Nintendo Switch (ported by Sumo Digital on February 27, 2018).In this sequel to Payday: The Heist, players team up as masked criminals as they descend on Washington, D.C. (among, later on, other locales) for an epic crime spree. The crew now take advantage of CRIMENET, an underground criminal network (led by their handler, the mysterious Bain) where they accept contracts from criminal contacts such as deranged up-and-coming Vlad the Ukrainian, shady American politician ""The Elephant"", and Colombian drug trafficker Hector.Using the CRIMENET interface, players can progress through various sizes of heists (from small-time convenience stores to major bank vaults), upgrade their criminal's special skills through Skill Trees, purchase various unlocked weapons and weapon modifications, and customize their unlocked masks with randomly-earned materials, patterns, and pattern colors. Along with an expanded metagame, the game now takes advantage of heists that are both dynamic (with random events and object placements), extended (sometimes splitting the heist into separate levels, or ""days""), and completely stealthable.Over the years, most of Payday 2's gameplay mechanics in the Steam version were updated, expanded, and sometimes completely revamped (including new weapon and enemy types, additional difficulty levels, the ability to drive vehicles, a complete restructure of the Skill Tree system, and full VR support). The game has also received numerous downloadable content packs (both free and paid), adding additional weapons, heists, playable characters, and masks. Most of these content and updates were rolled into later console versions.The game received numerous cross-promotional content with not only other games (such as Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and Hotline Miami), but also feature films (such as John Wick and Scarface). Some parts of downloadable content were also made outside of Overkill, such as music tracks by electronica artist Le Castle Vania and heists from spin-off developer LionGameLion (who later used the same engine and concept for RAID: World War II).GameplayOffshore AccountWith each successful heist accomplished you will receive two different types of payments. Your offshore account is money that is presented to you at the beginning of a heist, it is a set amount given if you accomplish all parts of a heist successfully.

As the difficulty gets higher, new types of enemies appear and other enemies get higher vitality. On the Death Wish and One Down difficulties, enemies get a higher resistance to headshots.Normal EnemiesNormal enemies are the most common type of enemies encountered and usually carry no special traits. They can be intimidated with the Dominator ability to surrender (as a hostage) and can be persuaded to fight on the players' side by someone with the Joker skill. Other skills in the Mastermind's Controller tree can give persuaded enemies buffs.Security GuardsWeak security guards who patrol a given area, causing difficulty to players who want to stealth the mission. They have a variety of outfits and weaponry, sometimes having increased durability (as the case with the Murkywater guards in the Shadow Raid heist).In addition to bypassing them, they can be taken down in one hit (when not alerted) and can be dominated easily. Either way, a player must answer a pager located on the dead/cuffed enemy in order for the alarm not to be raised. If the player answers more than four pagers, cancels interaction with the pager, or fails to respond to the pager after a short amount of time, the alarm is immediately raised.If the guard detects suspicious behavior (such as loud gunfire, broken cameras, and loot bags), they will raise an alarm and call their operator using their earpiece. If the player fails to eliminate them while he's calling their operator (and there is no ECM Jammer in place), the alarm is immediately raised. Guards also draw their weapons and can fire at a nearby player (causing all other guards to be alarmed).It is possible for the guard, when detecting a nearby player, to place that player in handcuffs, causing temporary incapacitation. Players who are cuffed can be uncuffed by another player or can successfully lockpick their handcuffs (after one minute elapses).SWAT TeamsThe most common enemies found in the game, these squads are known for being distinct based on their difficulty level:Regular SWAT squads with blue uniforms and either SMGs and pump-action shotguns. They are commonly found in the Normal and Hard difficulties. In the Hard difficulty, they are given heavier armor, distinct yellow shoulder armor, and assault rifles.FBI SWAT squads with green uniforms and either assault rifles or pump-action shotguns. They are commonly found in the Very Hard and Overkill difficulties.Elite SWAT squads with urban camo uniforms and a variety of weapons (including modified assault rifles). They are commonly found in the Mayhem and Death Wish difficulties.ZEAL SWAT (Force-Z Elite Assault Legion). They are only found in the Death Sentence difficulty.In addition, heavily-armored squads can be found in the Very Hard difficulty and above. Known as either ""Heavy SWAT"", ""Maximum Force Responders"", or ""MFRs"", they have body armor (distinctly tan/brown in the Very Hard and Overkill difficulties) that grant extra resistance to most small-arms fire.Unique UnitsThere are three special types of normal enemies that arrive in scripted sequences:First Responders resemble traditional police officers and usually arrive at the heist location in lower difficulties shortly after an alarm is raised. Similar to Security Guards, they are unarmored and have low vitality. They can also handcuff unattentive players that are close to them. Eliminating them before the first assault wave begins quickens the arrival of that wave. They can also appear during stealth missions, where they do not have pagers that needs answered.Hostage Rescue Teams resemble casually-dressed FBI agents and are sometimes sent in at lower difficulties for the sole purpose of rescuing hostages in the area. Sometimes these units wear light armor (distinct by their balaclavas) and utilize powerful sub-machine guns.Murkywater Units are distinct by their tactical green armor and only appear briefly in certain heists involving the PMC (Private Military Contractors). In the Shadow Raid heist, they act as more powerful Security Guards. In other heists, they act as normal enemies with more powerful weaponry.Special EnemiesSpecial enemies (sometimes referred in-game as ""specials"") are unique enemies that carry special traits. Their ability to take down players quickly forces players to adjust their strategy.While they cannot be intimidated into surrendering, they can be marked by players, temporarily alerting other players of their location (by showing a thin red outline around them, even through walls).ShieldsStandard pistol-equipped SWAT officers who carry riot shields to protect them and any units behind them. In later difficulties, these are changed to FBI SWAT officers with larger shields and sub-machine guns.While most weaponry cannot penetrate the riot shields (without special ammo, skills, or weapons), they can be flanked from the sides (and from behind) and can be stunned by grenades (or through melee attacks with a special Enforcer skill). Dropped riot shields can still block covering fire, to the benefit or detriment of the player.As players progress through the Crime Spree endurance mode, all Shields can receive a more powerful shield (that can bounce projectiles like rockets and arrows). In addition, they can be replaced by the same elite Shields as Captain Winters' squadron.TasersHeavily-armored SWAT units with tasers (in addition to their assault rifles) that can paralyze players where they stand.When they are close enough to a player (and have line-of-sight), they will charge their tasers (as noted by a high-pitched buzzing noise) before firing. The player who is hit will convulse (not allowing them to move or interact with any object) and randomly fire their weapons until the Taser is staggered/dead or until ten seconds elapses (in which the player will immediately become incapacitated).A special Ghost skill can allow quick-minded players to escape the effects of the Taser.As players progress through the Crime Spree endurance mode, all Tasers can receive a buff that reduces the amount of time required to incapacitate a tased player (from ten seconds to five seconds).MedicsLightly-armored SWAT units (noted by their bright red outfit) that are commonly found in the Overkill difficulty and above. Along with assault rifles and shotguns, they have the ability to heal injured enemies close to them (as shown by a small green outline around them).As players progress through the Crime Spree endurance mode, all Medics can receive numerous buffs to make them formidable enemies. These include an improved cooldown for their healing ability, a damage buff for other enemies healed, an instant heal to every enemy around a killed Medic, and a stackable damage buff for every enemy killed around a live Medic.They were added on October 13, 2016 and are not available in early console versions.SnipersWeak sniping enemies who, far away on windows and rooftops, can take out a large chunk of health and armor with their long-ranged rifles. After finding their perch, they will scan for players with a bright red laser sight.Unlike most special enemies, Bain will usually announce their arrival when they arrive in groups.CloakersPowerful stealth units who are quick and nimble, allowing them to bull-rush forward and incapacitate players with one well-placed kick. Fortunately, their lightly-armored helmets make their heads very weak targets.They will normally appear from unexpected locations, such as manhole covers and ventilation ducts (sometimes in close proximity to a player) and will always emit a low-pitched humming noise. Often times, they either hide in various locations (such as behind doors and under vehicles) or fire against the player (with their sub-machine guns) while evading player fire.When a Cloaker is ready to ambush a player, he will emit a higher-pitched shrill and rush towards the player (even following it around corners) before delivering a special kick (roundhouse, drop-kick, or somersault). If the player is close enough and behind an object, the Cloaker will instead perform a jump-kick over the object (rarely missing the player). Once the player is down, he will relentlessly beat the player with a baton while taunting (often breaking the fourth wall). If he is spotted by other players, he will throw down a smoke grenade and back away. If players are playing solo (without the use of Team AI), Cloakers will avoid this ambush and act like a regular enemy.As players progress through the Crime Spree endurance mode, all Cloakers can receive numerous buffs, including the ability to drop a smoke screen once they rush a player, drop tear gas once they die, and cuff a player once they rush them (ignoring all player ""downed"" effects).They were added on February 27, 2014.BulldozersOne of the strongest enemy in the game (and deadly in groups), Bulldozers wear huge bomb disposal suits and carry powerful weapons (causing massive damage if the player is in line-of-sight).While they have a large amount of vitality and heavy armor, they wear lightly-armored visors (which must be exposed by constant shots to the layered headpieces).They have received numerous updates since the game's official release to make them more difficult, such as giving them the ability to sprint and immunity to both stun and fire effects.There are five types of Bulldozers found in the main game:Green Bulldozers that wield pump-action shotguns. Powerful damage per shot, but low rate-of-fire and shorter range efficiency.Black Bulldozers that wield semi-automatic shotguns. Less damage per shot, but high rate-of-fire and longer range efficiency.GenSec Elite Bulldozers (known as ""Skulldozers"" due to wearing a skull decal on their faceplates) that wield light machine guns. Powerful damage and high rate-of-fire, despite a longer reload time. They were added in a later update, and are only found in the Mayhem difficulty and above (although a Crime Spree modifier replaces normal Bulldozers with them).Minigun Bulldozers (sporting woodland camo and a unique ""shark teeth"" visor) that sacrifice their movement speed for a powerful Vulcan Minigun. They were added in a later update (as a Crime Spree modifier), and was later made standard in the Death Sentence difficulty.Medic Bulldozers (sporting a red/white color scheme similar to other Medics) that sacrifice their firepower (giving them standard assault rifles) for the same healing ability as Medics (which can have the same Crime Spree buffs as them). They were added in a later update (as a Crime Spree modifier), and was later made standard in the Death Sentence difficulty.The Green, Black, and GenSec Elite Dozers have unique-looking counterparts when played on the Death Sentence (formerly One Down) difficulty. These are called ZEAL-Force Bulldozers (or ""Zealdozers"").An additional type of Bulldozer, the Headless Bulldozer, was found in the Safehouse Nightmare heist during the Halloween 2013 update. They are similar to Black Bulldozers, but they have no additional bonus to headshots (due to having no heads). For all Halloween updates afterwards, it was replaced with the Headless Titandozer. They are similar to Skulldozers, but have a very tiny headshot area (the neck stump) and a riot shield on their backs.As players progress through the Crime Spree endurance mode, all Bulldozers can receive numerous buffs (including immunity to explosive damage, and a ""berserker rage"" damage buff once their faceplates are destroyed).TurretsLocated at special locations of certain heists (either mounted on SWAT vans, helicopters, or indoor ceilings), Turrets are essentially enemy automated sentry guns that follow players around (with a bright red laser sight similar to Snipers) and provide powerful suppression fire (in which the Turret sometimes has to reload, as noted by a blinking yellow laser sight). Players with ECM Jammers can use it to automatically ""hack"" nearby Turrets to fight for them.While the bases of the Turrets themselves are indestructible, they have a shield around their ""targeting lens"", which serves as their weak point. Once the Turret is severely damaged, it retreats into the Turret base, where it is repaired to full strength. This can be repeated twice before it is permanently destroyed. The SWAT van Turret is unique as it deploys tear gas around it to ward off players that are too close.They were added on February 10, 2015 and are not available in early console versions.Captain WintersA unique ""boss"" enemy, Captain Neville Winters commands the Phalanx Defense Unit, a squadron of elite Shields that forms a phalanx to protect him. They only appear in certain heists and do not appear in the Normal or Hard difficulties. While his squadmates can be killed, he cannot die and will instead retreat after taking enough damage (removing him from the rest of the heist ""day"").The squadron moves in a tight group, carries short-ranged sub-machine guns, and remains stationary once it arrives at its destination. Despite this, each unit is heavily resistant to high single-burst damage (the only exception being explosive damage).While their presence is enough to lock down an area, his presence also has a unique effect for all enemies on the map. As long as the Captain is still active, the damage resistance of all enemies slowly rises (as a morale boost) to a point. Also, the Assault wave remains in effect as long as the Captain is still active, and goes away once the Captain retreats.He was added on September 14, 2015 and is not available in early console versions.Neutral UnitsSometimes, players encounter units that are not directly affiliated with the police. They cannot be intimidated by the Dominator ability and, in some cases, in-fight with the police.Only found in the beginning of some heists, standard gangsters and mobsters are weak unarmored enemies that use pistols or sub-machine guns. In some occasions, players can use stealth to bypass a loud fight with them. While they do not utilize pagers, alerting one of them can quickly alert the entire gang/mob. Also, in some occasions, these enemies initially appear friendly towards the players (but quickly turn when things go sour).Some heists have special boss characters that need to be eliminated before the heist can progress. This includes the Commissar in the Hotline Miami heist and the Informant in the Hoxton Revenge heist. While they are easy to kill in Stealth (due to weak weaponry and no armor), all bosses carry heavy armor and powerful weaponry when things go loud (making them nearly as powerful as Bulldozers).SkillsReplacing the Upgrades system of Payday: The Heist is the ""Skills"" system, in which players can upgrade each of five unique skill trees using a limited amount of ""Skill Points"" (corresponding to their current overall reputation level), granting them unique and beneficial bonuses (which can be further upgraded for additional bonuses).Unlike the Upgrades system, access to weapons, deployables, and specific weapon upgrades are not tied to skill trees (with the exception of akimbo weapons in some versions of the game and deployables in earlier versions of the game).The Skills system received a major overhaul in the Steam and later console versions, adding separate sub-trees for each skill tree while revamping all skills and reducing the number of skill tiers (allowing a wider variety of powerful combinations). Players can now unlock new ""Skill Sets"", which allows them to use separate skill combinations for different loadouts (which can be swapped in the middle of multi-day heists). Unlocking new skill tiers formerly gave passive bonuses for the player, which are now instead put into the Perk Deck system. Unlocking (and upgrading) skills formerly required cash and could not be refunded individually (instead refunding an entire skill tree with most of the cash used).MastermindThe Mastermind tree is beneficial for players who want to medically support their teammates and control tense situations (from any range).The Medic sub-tree improves the efficiency of both Doctor Bags and First Aid Kits while improving he player's ability to revive other players. The tier-4 Inspire skill allows players to shout at friendly players to improve their mobility and, at times, instantly revive them.The Controller sub-tree improves the player's ability to control civilians while allowing dominated enemies to fight for them. The tier-4 Hostage Taker skill allows players to regenerate health by having hostages or converted enemies.The Sharpshooter sub-tree improves the efficiency of weapons in single-shot mode, most notably Assault Rifles, SMGs, and Sniper Rifles. The tier-4 Graze skill allows players to deal damage in an area-of-effect when hitting with a Sniper Rifle.In earlier version of the game, spending SP on the Mastermind tree unlocks the Doctor Bag, which can be placed to allow players to fully heal and reset the number of ""bleedouts"" before being taken into custody. Each Doctor Bag has a limited amount of uses for being removed from the game.EnforcerThe Enforcer tree is beneficial for players who prefer close-combat aggression, increasing their armor and ammo capabilities.The Shotgunner sub-tree improves the player's efficiency with shotguns. The tier-4 Overkill skill gives the player a temporary damage buff after killing with a shotgun or portable saw.The Tank sub-tree improves armor efficiency. The tier-4 Iron Man skill significantly improves the total armor value while granting access to the bulkiest armor of the game: the Improved Combat Tactical Vest.The Ammo Specialist sub-tree improves the efficiency of dropped ammo boxes, Ammo Bags, and the OVE9000 portable circular saw (allowing players to take it as a secondary weapon). The tier-4 Fully Loaded skill increases ammo capacity and ammo box gain while giving players a chance to pick up throwables from dropped ammo boxes.In earlier version of the game, spending SP on the Enforcer tree unlocks the Ammo Bag, which can be placed to allow players to fully restock their weapons. Each Ammo Bag has a limited amount of uses (depending on the amount of ammo restocked) before being removed from the game.TechnicianThe Technician tree is beneficial for players who work with a variety of devices (including drills, multi-functional explosives, and automated sentry guns), as well as players who use full-auto weaponry.The Engineer sub-tree improves the efficiency of Sentry Guns. The tier-4 Tower Defense skill allows players to carry up to 3 additional Sentry Guns (which can be combined with an upgraded Jack of All Trades skill to allow players to carry a second deployable at half-capacity).The Breacher sub-tree improves the efficiency of both Drills and Trip Mines. The tier-4 Fire Trap skill turns the Trip Mine into an incendiary mine for area-of-denial.The Oppressor sub-tree improves the efficiency of weapons in full-auto mode, most notably Assault Rifles, SMGs, and LMGs. The tier-4 Body Expertise skill allows players to apply the headshot bonus to any area of the body when using certain full-auto weapons.In earlier version of the game, spending SP on the Technician tree unlocks the Trip Mine, which can be placed to explode when an enemy passes through its laser sensor (and later allow players to use them to non-exploding motion sensors and specialized ""shaped charges"" for breaching certain doors and objects). Certain skills in the game would also unlock the Sentry Gun, which can be deployed to automatically fire upon enemies for a short amount of time (until it runs out of ammo, in which the player can replenish it with their own ammo, or until it is destroyed by enemies).GhostThe Ghost tree is beneficial both for players who want new tricks in stealthy situations and for agile players who want to avoid enemy gunfire.The Shinobi sub-tree improves the player's stealth abilities and tools, including improved body bag and lockpicking efficiency, new uses for ECM Jammers, improved casing mode, new heist assets, and the ability to disable cameras and detect nearby enemies. The tier-4 ECM Specialist skill further improves use of ECM Jammers while having them delay pager calls.The Artful Dodger sub-tree improves the player's overall speed and stamina while allowing them to escape certain situations (such as staggering enemies on broken armor and freeing themselves from Tasers). The tier-4 Sneaky Bastard skill significantly improves dodge chance on light builds.The Silent Killer sub-tree improves the efficiency of silenced weapons while improving the ""enemy marking"" ability and granting critical hit chance depending on the player's situation. The tier-4 Unseen Strike skill improves the chance for critical hits while undamaged.In earlier version of the game, spending SP on the Ghost tree unlocks the ECM Jammer, which can be placed to temporarily disable electronic devices, such as surveillance cameras and pagers (and later allow players to interact with it to cause a ""feedback loop"", which has a chance to stun nearby enemies).FugitiveThe Fugitive tree is beneficial for riskier players who prefers secondary handguns and melee combat, while improving their survivability from a downed state.The Gunslinger sub-tree improves the efficiency of handguns and akimbo weapons. The tier-4 Trigger Happy skill allows players to significantly buff their damage with quick consecutive pistol hits.The Revenant sub-tree gives new tools for the player's ""downed"" state and improves their recovery from that state. The tier-4 Messiah skill allows players to revive themselves from killing an enemy (using a charge that, once the skill is Aced, can be recovered with Doctor Bags).The Brawler sub-tree improves the player's melee capabilities. The tier-4 Frenzy skill reduces the player's maximum health and healing, but gives them improved damage resistance (which can be combined with the Berserker skill for improved damage output).This skill tree was added in the Hoxton Breakout update and is unavailable in the early console versions. Earlier versions of the skill tree was different and focused instead on agility and survivability with light armor. In some versions of the game, spending SP on the Fugitive tree unlocks the First Aid Kit, smaller one-use versions of the Doctor Bag which can be placed to allow players to quickly and fully heal (without resetting their number of ""bleedouts""). Certain skills in the game would also unlock the Body Bag Case, which can be placed to allow players to replenish their count of body bags.HeistsThere are multiple contract brokers that players can earn (or purchase) jobs from. Some heists are sold as downloadable content, in which players can only receive those jobs if they own the corresponding DLC packs. Players without the DLC can still join games of other players who do and can still earn job-specific achievements; however if those achievements would unlock cosmetic items, the items remain locked until that player has purchased the DLC.Early console versions of the game only include the base game heists and two post-release heists (Diamond Store and all Transport heists).Crime SpreeReplacing the Pro Jobs feature of earlier versions of the game is the Crime Spree endurance mode, which allows players to chain together heist ""days"" in a row to earn bigger rewards (including continental coins and unique loot). Players can only start a Crime Spree once they reach non-Infamous level 60.Players start at a Spree Rank of 0 and increase this rank by completing more heists without failure. Like Pro Jobs, players cannot reset the mission mid-game. If the player fails a heist or leaves in the middle of a game, they must spend continental coins (relative to the Spree Rank) to continue their spree. Otherwise, they will have to ""cash out"" their rewards and start over from the beginning. Optionally, they can start at later Spree Ranks by spending continental coins.As players earn a higher Spree Rank, the game gets progressively harder for both Loud and Stealth missions, as lobby leaders are forced to choose special modifiers to increase enemy efficiency (including powerful buffs for special enemies) and make it easier for the alarms to be raised (including a strict limit in the amount of civilians that can be killed). For every Spree Rank interval of 50, enemies gain extra health and deal extra damage.Pro JobsIn earlier console versions (and the Steam version prior to October 8, 2016), some heists also have an alternate ""Pro Job"". Although these missions earn players more experience points and cash, failure to complete the mission terminates the contract entirely (disabling the ability to reset the mission, even mid-game).Missions that included a Pro counterpart were The Biker Heist, Election Day, Firestarter, Framing Frame, Goat Simulator, Hotline Miami, Hoxton Breakout, Rats, and Watchdogs. Missions that could ONLY be completed as Pro Jobs were Bank Heist (random), Bank Heist (gold), Big Oil, and Ukrainian Job.Unique MissionsThere are three types of missions that are not accessible via normal means:Accessing the crew's safehouses without any firefights. The first safehouse players encounter, taking place hidden within a Laundromat, serves as the game's initial single-player tutorial sequence and contains an assortment of decorative and training rooms. On later console versions and the Steam version (after October 9, 2016), reaching reputation level 25 and visiting the Laundromat safehouse will cause the player to ""move"" to a larger Safe House building. This building contains upgradable rooms (using continental coins as currency) and contain a variety of interactive things to do with the game lobby (including changing the escape van color scheme, gambling, and running through a killhouse course). Players can earn decorative trophies for the Safe House by performing tasks in the game. In addition, the Safe House hosts a butler (named Aldstone) with the voice and likeness of veteran comedy actor John Cleese.Basic Heists, introduced on June 9, 2016. There are 2 two-day single-player variations of this: one as a tutorial for Loud mechanics (Get the Coke) and one as a tutorial for Stealth mechanics (Flash Drive). Players are locked into a single pre-made loadout (playing as Dallas with the default AMCAR and Chimano 88 weapons) and learn the basic mechanics of the game.Safe House Raids, introduced on October 11, 2016. is unlocked once the player unlocks the Safe House building. Every three days, the player gets an alert that the safehouse is being raided by police and can either skip it (""let the crew take care of it"", which postpones the event until the next day) or defend money bags from multiple waves of enemies. Other players can join in on this defense and claim the same rewards.EscapesCafeGarageOverpassParkStreetBainA mysterious figure, Bain is the main handler of the Payday crew (whose voice guides players throughout each mission) and the creator of CRIMENET. Originally, his missions involved simple no-nonsense robberies (including jewelry stores and banks). Over time, Bain issued numerous simple missions with no real story (just rewards for the gang).Bank Heist - A simple bank robbery in downtown D.C. Unlike most missions, Bank Heist is split up into four separate heists, each with deposit boxes inside the bank's vault as well as other loot (either bundles of cash, bundles of gold, nothing, or either one of the three scenarios at random). Can be completed in stealth.Jewelry Store - Generally regarded as the simplest heist in the game, the crew have to hold-up a jewelry store to steal its goods. Can be completed in stealth.Diamond Store - Similar to Jewelry Store, Diamond Store has the crew robbing a fancier jewelry store in downtown D.C. Stealth tactics are much harder here, as the area has extra security precautions. Can be completed in stealth. Introduced on September 13, 2013.Transport (DLC) - A series of missions based around stopping an armored truck convoy and breaking into them to get the loot inside. Like Bank Heist, Transport is split up into five separate heists, each in a different location: Crossroads, Downtown, Harbor, Park, and Underpass. Originally, players can find hidden ""intel"" that adds a bonus day to the mission (see Train Heist below). Added on November 14, 2013.Transport: Train Heist (DLC) - The gang have to break into a parked train to steal a prototype turret (closely resembling the Sentry Gun from Team Fortress 2) and many bags of ammunition (that are highly volatile). Can be completed in stealth. Added on November 14, 2013.GO Bank - A winter-time bank robbery that's a little more complicated than the usual Bank Heist. Robbing the place without a firefight is a race against time, while doing it loud requires a tricky method of evacuating the loot (involving airlifting a cage with a biplane). A cross-promotion with Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, the area itself is based off of the latter's ""Bank"" map. Can be completed in stealth. Added on December 16, 2013.Shadow Raid - Break silently into the storage depot for the Murkywater mercenary organization and steal a variety of confiscated goods (from weapon caches to ancient artifacts). This heist can only be done in stealth, as players have one minute to evacuate with the minimum required loot once the alarm is raised. Added on May 29, 2014.Art Gallery - Returning to the art gallery from the first day of the Framing Frame heist, the crew now steal the art for themselves. Can be completed in stealth. Added on October 24, 2014.Cook Off - Returning to the dilapidated house from the first day of the Rats heist, the crew now cooks as much meth as they can for profit. Unlike the version in the Rats heist, players call in airdrops of ingredients at regular intervals (allowing the heist to continue indefinitely). Added on March 13, 2015.Car Shop - The crew has to break in to a high-end car dealership to steal sports cars. The heist is notable for introducing drive-able vehicles to the game. As firefights risk heavily damaging the cars, this heist can only be done in stealth. Once the alarm is raised (as the getaway path requires an explosion), players have a limited amount of time (dependent on difficulty) to both steal the cars and reach the exit. Added on March 18, 2015.The Alesso Heist (DLC) - The GenSec security corporation is showing off their latest safe in an sports arena currently hosting a concert by famous swedish DJ Alesso. The crew must maneuver the heavily-guarded back areas of the arena and use the concert's pyrotechnics to mask an explosive break-in. Can be completed in stealth. Added on May 21, 2015.Reservoir Dogs Heist - A cross-promotion with the 1992 film Reservoir Dogs. Unlike other heists, this one is presented in reverse order (with players playing through Day 2 first). After a hit of a Los Angeles jewelry store with the crew of the Cabot crime family goes wrong (with Bain himself kidnapped), the gang must hold out in a morgue while securing bags of diamonds. Added on December 14, 2017.VladAn eccentric Ukrainian mob boss, Vlad's heists are off-beat and are usually done loud. He is also the main contractor for the game's holiday events (involving his drug-smuggling operation in wrapped gifts).Four Stores - Vlad needs the payday gang to knock over some stores his rival owns. Can be completed in stealth.Mallcrasher - Vlad needs the payday gang to go show the owner of a mall what happens when he doesn't pay protection money.Nightclub - Vlad's nightclub isn't that popular, so he asks the payday gang to go steal from his competitor.

The payday gang are sent to steal it. Can be completed in stealth.White Xmas - Vlad's pilot crashed a plane full of high-quality Colombian cocaine on Christmas. The payday gang are sent to retrieve the pilot and as much of the cocaine as they can get out. Added on December 4, 2014.Meltdown - Based in the same warehouse as Shadow Raid, this is a loud only heist where the payday gang have to use forklifts to steal nukes. Added on May 7, 2015.Aftershock - Added on October 17, 2015.Santa's Workshop - Added on December 11, 2015.Goat Simulator (DLC) - A cross-promotion with the game of the same name.

Added on February 27, 2020.Buluc's Mansion (DLC) - Can be completed in stealth. Added on November 11, 2020.Black Cat (DLC) - Can be completed in stealth. Added on October 13, 2021.The ElephantA shady Republican congressman (later a senator), the politician known as The Elephant recruits the Payday gang to help him with his political interests. His main missions benefit highly from stealth (as going loud makes the situation more difficult), giving high rewards for a successful completion. His missions also require multiple ""days"" to complete.Big Oil - A scientist has come up with an alternate clean energy source that could put a lot of The Elephants benefactors out of business. The payday gang are sent in to steal it. Both parts can be completed in stealth.Framing Frame - Framing Frame is a heist based around ruining The Elephant's opponent's reputation. First the payday gang steals paintings from an art gallery (Later seperated off into a seperate heist contracted by Bain), then gets cameras placed inside them covertly, then sells them to The Senator's people and uses the cameras to break into his penthouse apartment and plant cocaine in his vault. All parts can be completed in stealth.Election Day - The mayoral elections are happening and The Elephant wants to make sure that his candidate is the one that is elected. The payday gang have to break into a shipping yard to track the voting machines, then go hack them in favor of The Elephants candidate. Both parts can be completed in stealth (provided the first part leads to the correct warehouse). Added on March 20, 2014.The Biker Heist (DLC) - Added on June 16, 2016.HectorA powerful Colombian drug lord, Hector recruits the Payday gang to not only help out with his drug trafficking, but to escalate the conflict with a rival cartel (the Mendozas). His missions require multiple ""days"" to complete and are usually done loud.Firestarter - Firestarter is a mission where Hector wants the payday gang to cripple the resources of a rival cartel, the Mendozas. This involves stealing guns from an airport (With the option to destroy them), stealing a server from the FBI, and then finally breaking into the bank from Bank Heist and burning the Mendoza cash reserves. While all parts can be completed in stealth, it is very difficult to do so.Rats - In Rats, Hector wants the payday gang to take out a rival cartel. This requires the gang to cook meth to sell to gangsters, who have a file that describes where and how the cartel are being taken out of the country by the FBI.Watchdogs - Watchdogs is a mission where the payday gang have to escort Hector's cocaine to the dropoff, however they are ambushed by the police on the first day and have to get the cocaine onto a boat in the second part of the heist.The DentistA mysterious agent who hides in plain sight as a practicing dentist, the contractor known as The Dentist recruits the Payday gang for three high-risk high-reward heists (requiring either aggressive shootouts or complex stealth routes) that require careful pre-planning. In return, he assists the crew find and retrieve the original Hoxton. He is played by American actor Giancarlo Esposito.The Big Bank (DLC) - The Benevolent Bank has never been broken into, but the Dentist believes the payday gang can do it. This heist is notable for being the introduction of the 'Preplanning' feature, whereas before assets in the levels were randomly placed. Can be completed in stealth. Added on June 17, 2014.Hotline Miami (DLC) - The Dentist asks for a favor before he helps break Hoxton out of jail. A cross-promotion with the game series of the same name. Added on September 30, 2014.Hoxton Breakout - The payday gang has to break Hoxton out while he's headed to a retrial.

Assisting the team is their handler: the mysterious Bain.Along with special updates (including a cross-promotion with Valve's Left 4 Dead series) and an expansion DLC, the game later received a full-blown sequel (which has received numerous upgrades and alterations, including a wide variety of game updates and new content since its release). Most of the game's levels were later re-made into its sequel, each of which were enhanced to fit the new engine.As part of a special promotion, the game was made free for 24 hours on October 17, 2014.GameplayPlayers can choose to play as either an assault, sharpshooter, or support class. Each class can be leveled up over the course of play, and as new levels are reached, new weapons, items, and abilities become accessible. Abilities affected by the leveling system include healing, ammunition dispersal, and binding hostages. Respawns are determined by the number of hostages the player is willing to trade. Objective locations and path requirements vary from session to session, and some optional objectives become available at times that, while not required, can speed up the players' progress in the mission when completed.Over the course of a mission, the police will come in waves and the AI will adapt based on the player's performance. Police officers utilize a variety of armaments, including smoke bombs and tasers, and some wear heavy armor, requiring more firepower in order to successfully take them down.CharactersEach player choose from four playable characters, each with their own appearance, voice, and backstory:Dallas - American. Formerly a mobster. His standard mask is a red-white-and-blue ""American flag"" clown mask.Hoxton - British. Formerly a street hooligan.

Unlike the two games before it, Metro Exodus features more of an open-world structure across several different areas.StoryFollowing the events of Metro: Last Light, Artyom becomes disillusioned with the political and social structures in the metro system and beings making regular excursions to the surface with a radio to search for outside broadcasts from other survivors. He begins hearing faint signals, but is unable to clearly receive the messages.On one such excursion, Artyom and his wife Anna witness a train traveling along a railway and are apprehended by soldiers from Hansa, one of the major metro civilizations and an adversary of the Spartan Order to which the two belong. During their escape, the two accidentally disable a radio jammer that had secretly been blocking outside broadcasts from reaching Moscow, causing a flood of messages from around the world to pour in.With the help of Yermak, himself a disillusioned Hansa resident, Artyom and Anna escape aboard the train and are nearly captured again when Colonel Miller and his Spartans intercept and save them. Miller reveals he knew about the radio jammers. According to Miller, the war that destroyed the world is still ongoing, justifying the jammers as a way to isolate and protect Moscow. The Spartans discuss returning to the metro to reveal this truth to its residents, but believing that Hansa will have them executed for what they've done, decide the only course of action is to proceed towards the Ark, where the last remnants of Russia's government is believed to be holed up.GameplayMuch like the previous two games, Metro Exodus has a strong emphasis on survival mechanics. While exploring, players must be mindful of their supply of ammunition, healing supplies, and other items like air filters and throwables.CombatIn his travels, Artyom encounters human and mutant enemies that can be engaged loudly or stealthily. Artyom carries with him a backpack that is used to change weapon attachments and to craft simple items. Every weapon in the game can be outfitted with a variety of barrels, stocks, optics, magazines, and laser sights. These are acquired by dismantling weapons found in the environment or on dead enemies. Every weapon the player picks up is permanently added to Artyom's collection back at the train. The train is the only location where the player can change their equipped weapons aside from swapping them in the field.As a weapon is used, it will begin to accumulate dirt that will eventually cause it to start jamming. Weapons can be cleaned at workbenches found throughout each region. These workbenches also allow the player to craft ammunition and are often accompanied by a bed that allows the player to sleep till day or night.Radiation is less of an issue in Metro Exodus due to it taking place outside of Moscow, but there are still areas that necessitate the use of a gas mask. The air filter on the mask must be swapped every few minutes while in use. As the player takes damage, the mask may become damaged to the point where Artyom begins to suffocate. Holes in the mask can be quick-fixed in the field using tape, limiting the player's vision. Repairing the mask proper requires a workbench.ExplorationEach region of Metro Exodus is a self-contained open world environment with locations to explore. The player can use binoculars to identify locations to be marked on the map, such as bandit camps, ruined structures for looting, and safe houses. Some of the game's regions have vehicles to facilitate travel, such as a row boat or a van, as well as ziplines to allow for a quick and safe descent from tall structures. There is a day/night cycle that affects ease of stealth and in some cases the type of enemies in the environment, as well as a dynamic weather system.ExpansionsThe Two ColonelsAfter Artyom and Colonel Miller split up in Novosibirsk, Miller sets off alone into the Metro to find a satellite map detailing the location and radioactivity of Lake Baikal. He is guided over a radio by a young boy named Kirill, the lone survivor of a devastating war that took place in the city's Metro.The Two Colonels features the boy's father, Lieutenant-Colonel Slava Khlebnikov, as the protagonist during the final year of the Novosibirsk Metro's life. Khlebnikov, an officer in the station's OSKOM military police force, directs his men on excursions deep into the Metro to burn away an invasive organic slime that periodically spreads throughout the tunnels.Meanwhile, the station has begun running low on ""green stuff,"" an anti-radiation medicine that had been sustaining the Metro's population beneath the heavily radiated ruins of Novosibirsk. OSKOM begins confiscating excess supplies of ""green stuff"" from residents, causing discontent.Unable to solve the ""green stuff"" shortage, OSKOM announces an evacuation of the Metro. At the same time, a civil war erupts between the Metro's residents and OSKOM. During the battle, Khlebnikov witnesses OSKOM General Tolya releasing poison gas into the Metro. In the ensuing confrontation, Tolya reveals that enough ""green stuff"" remains to sustain OSKOM's leadership only, and the poison gas is their attempt to mercy kill the residents on their way out.General Toyla commits suicide after learning that the evacuation has left without him, and Khlebnikov survives the battle. Disillusioned with OSKOM and determined to save his son, he sets out into a bunker in the city ruins to find a the satellite map of Lake Baikal. He successfully retrieves the map, but succumbs to radiation poisoning shortly thereafter.One month later, Colonel Miller, having followed Khlebnikov's journey, finds the colonel's body and retrieves the map.Sam's StoryFollowing the end of Metro Exodus, the American member of the Spartans, Samuel Taylor, decides to leave the crew to pursue his dream of finding passage back to the United States to reunite with his father. He sets out alone in the crew's van and reaches Vladivostok.On the outskirts of Vladivostok, Sam encounters a Captain named Eduard Baranov, who points Sam to an operational nuclear submarine sitting in the harbor. Baranov was the commander of the submarine during the war that destroyed the world, and explains that he never allowed any of its missiles to fire.Sam is shortly thereafter captured by some men who take him to the submarine, where he meets another American named Tom. Tom has a plan to refuel the submarine and use its nuclear arsenal as power projection, promising to take Sam to San Diego if he helps accomplish this task.Sam ventures out into the ruins of Vladivostok with the help of Captain Baranov. The two are eventually successful in retrieving the fuel rods needed to power the submarine. On the way back, Baranov reveals that the fuel rods have a built-in self-destruct mechanism designed to eliminate any chance of the submarine being captured, and asks Artyom to consider detonating the charges to prevent Tom from having access to the craft's intact arsenal.Upon returning to the submarine, one of Tom's former subordinates, Krim, launches an attack. Krim had grown disillusioned with Tom's philosophy of power projection, believing instead that the nuclear weapons on board should be used offensively right away. Sam helps put down the attack as Tom and Captain Baranov sail out into the harbor.Depending on the player's choice, Sam can either board the submarine and travel to the United States, or detonate the fuel rods and sink it.Enhanced EditionMetro Exodus Enhanced Edition, free to all owners of the original game, was released for PC on May 6, 2021.

DLC has added Operation Barbarossa (1941) and the 1943-5 march of the Soviet army to Berlin. Both Soviet and Nazi German sides are playable during all campaigns. Supply line management is stressed as well as detailed weather modeling.GameplayAlthough outwardly similar to the Panzer General series, Unity of Command adds a significant twist with its supply line mechanic.Throughout the map, there are several supply depots, each with a range value. Supply only reaches hexes within range of a depot. If a unit starts its turn out of supply, it is penalized with escalating disadvantages depending on the number of consecutive turns it is out of supply:Existing suppressed ""steps"" (i.e. unit strength / hp) are not replenishedUnit cannot attack and some additional steps are suppressedUnit is completely suppressed. It is extremely weak and can often be killed with a single attack.With this knowledge, it is essential to maintain a defended path to one's own supply (at least enough to ensure the enemy cannot cut the path) while threatening the enemy's lines.For example, a row of experienced, entrenched infantry will be very hard to dislodge but you only need to remove one unit and then funnel a stream of units through the hole. Then avoid the remaining defenders and take their supply depot. The AI will be forced to abandon its defensive position to deal with your threat even before you reach the depot. It would otherwise find itself quickly suppressed and unable to deal with your maneuver.CampaignThere is a campaign which initially starts with historical battles. As the player progresses and depending on the results of certain key battles, new battles may appear, some historical and some ""what-if"" scenarios.Units are not maintained between campaign battles but prestige (earned by capturing objective points quicker) is maintained, allowing purchase of more expensive units for the battle, reinforcements, etc.FeaturesEntire 1942/43 Stalingrad Campaign on the Eastern FrontOperation units (Corps level)Historically accurate force levelsCampaign has both historical and what-if scenariosMultiplayer can be played asynchronously as game is server mediatedDeveloper- and user-created scenariosUnit zones of controlUnit experience levelsSpecialists attachments (e.g. artillery, AT-guns, pioneer)Terrain bonuses and penalitesDLCRed Turn: The Road to Berlin 1943-45Black Turn: Operation Barbarossa 1941PC/Mac/Linux System RequirementsMinimum:OS: Windows XP, OSX 10.6Processor: 1.6 GHzMemory: 1 GB RAMHard Drive: 150 MB HD space",,,,,,,,,

1448950,Glitch Assassin,499,Lone Wolf Interactive,Lone Wolf Interactive,0,0,0,"Action, Indie",English,,,"OverviewIx, one of the game's more... surreal areas.Glitch takes the accessible point-and-click elements of popular social media games such as Farmville and incorporates them into a large, persistent online world where players can interact, trade items and help build new areas of the world through community ""projects"". MMORPG staples such as experience points, skill trees, and quests are also present.The story revolves around the 11 Giants, who dreamed up the world in which Glitch takes place. The customizable avatars the player controls, or ""Glitches"", are figments of the Giants' imaginations that maintain and develop this dream world. The antithesis of the Giants are the Rooks, giant black birds that eat away at neglected areas.GameplayUralia, a region known for its Dr. Seuss-esque landscape.Glitch's character progression occurs by gaining experience points by performing tasks, completing quests and achievements, improving skills, and interacting and trading with other players for mutual gain. There are hundreds of activities to do in Glitch, all with distinct skill tree paths: Cooking, Gardening, Mining, Animal Husbandry, etc.The character's actions are limited by two stats: Energy and Mood. Energy is used for most actions and is depleted for performing more labor intensive actions (such as mining metal rocks), but the energy cost can be reduced by increasing the skill level for that action. Energy can generally be restored by food. Mood is a separate stat that decreases or increases depending on certain actions. Loss of Mood lowers the amount of XP the character gains for actions.Skills are unlocked by selecting them in the Skill Tree, which starts a countdown timer. Once the timer, runs out, another skill can be selected. The learning time can range from minutes to days depending on the skill level and how much of the Skill Tree is filled out. The learning time can be shortened by donating to a Giant's Shrine and sacrificing items to gain ""Favor"". Most skills require prerequisite skills to be learned or certain related achievements to be completed. Achievements are typically learned by performing an action a certain number of times: for instance, cooking with the Knife & Board 11 times will bestow a Cooking Achievement.There is a vast crafting system, and almost every item can be used in a recipe with something else to make a better, more valuable items that can be sold, donated to a Giant's Shrine to increase favor, or crafted into an even better item. By unlocking higher level skills, more complex recipes can be crafted.ClosingAs of November, 15, 2012, it was announced that the game with be ending on December 9th, 2012 due to not attracting a larger audience. There was a page with a FAQ setup explaining why here. The game had a quite dedicated community around it while in existence.",,,,,,,,,

It stands as the developer's debut offering and is available on the Android and iOS platforms. While the very core mechanic is to match colors and eliminate blocks, the structure and execution of the game is vastly different from popular color-matching puzzlers.ExecutionSetting up for an orange 5-chainIn Mosaique, the player attempts to rid the screen of all colored blocks that lie in the center of a square-shaped ""arena"". The player controls a shooter, which s/he rotates around the perimeter of the arena with on-screen clockwise/counter-clockwise buttons. The shooter is a colored block, just like those which populate the arena. When the player fires, the shooter flies out in a straight line towards the opposite end of the arena. If the shooter comes in contact with any blocks, it:eliminates blocks of the same color and continues flyingswaps places with blocks of a different color (excluding black)is reflected back to its starting point by black blockschanges color to match the non-black block closest to it if it has removed the last block of its current colorGiven these basic rules, the player can re-arrange the color lineup of the blocks in the arena in order to set up long strings of blocks that the player can clear in a single shot, gathering extra points. Each extra block cleared in a single shot acts as a multiplier, so the motivation is there to attempt to set up long strings of blocks whenever possible.(An illustration of the rules per the screenshot: The shooter will fire off to the right, eliminate the five orange blocks, then swap places with the green block before returning to its starting point outside the arena... at which point it will be green.)Shot Meter and Losing StateThere's an additional point of motivation to clearing long strings. Every time the player fires, a meter at the bottom of the screen depletes. Should the meter empty out, the game is over. When the player has cleared two or more blocks in a single shot, the meter will be replenished by an amount dependent on the number of blocks cleared. Especially in ""Expert"" mode, where each shot depletes the meter much more than in ""Normal"" mode, clearing long strings--while minimizing shots that only serve to swap colors--is essential.If the shot meter fills, the shooter is then able to clear blocks of any color on the following shot. This includes the black reflective blocks. Therefore, it's possible to clear an entire row of blocks--regardless of color--and re-fill the shot meter completely, giving you another opportunity to repeat the feat.The VacuumPoints and meter are visually represented on the playing field as little bits that fly out of the eliminated blocks, which are then absorbed by your shooter. However, in later levels, the game will put a ""vacuum"" block in the center of the arena. The vacuum will suck in a portion of the bits, thus reducing the amount of points you score as well as the meter you replenish every time you make a successful match. As the vacuum can be eliminated by any color, it's crucial to find a way to get rid of it as soon as possible--the most efficient method is to eliminate it as part of a chain.StructureEvery game session is comprised of seven separate levels, each one progressively more complex than the last both in terms of quantity of blocks as well as the organization of colors and reflective black blocks. Once you have completed the seven levels, you are given a score tally and are ""done"" for the day, although you are free to re-play the game as many times as you want. If you play Mosaique every day of the week, you will be granted bonus points.",,,,,,,,,

It was announced at E3 2010, and was released on March 13, 2012. Much like their previous two titles, it aims to be more of an unusual, experimental experience rather than a traditional game and is meant to evoke strong emotions from the player. It is the final game in a three-game deal that thatgamecompany signed with Sony, and was part of the Spring Fever promotion on PSN. On March 29, 2012, Jenova Chen announced, on his blog, that Journey had become the fastest selling game ever released in the SCEA region on the PlayStation Network. On July 21, 2015, Journey was re-released on the Playstation 4 and was cross-buy with the Playstation 3 digital version.StoryJourney has an ambiguous story that takes place in a ravaged landscape dotted with ruins. When the player begins a new journey, their character is sitting in a desert, with no backstory, name, or apparent purpose besides reaching the glowing mountain in the distance.During Journey, the player will come upon two direct forms of storytelling. The first form they will encounter is glyphs, mosaic stonework that reveals some of the history of the area. The second form comes in between level visions. In these cutscenes a large white-robed figure shares, in pictographic vignettes, the past, present, and future of the player. The following is a literal interpretation, although many figurative interpretations are no less valid.The world of Journey wasn't always in ruins. A white-robed culture once thrived here, at first living with nature and soon, with the help of the same power that allows the player's character to fly, overwhelming nature with structures, building higher and higher.When this power dwindled, the culture split into warring tribes, building mechanical insectoid war machines rather than buildings. The war killed many, explaining the graves littering the landscape as the player progresses.In its wake, the war left the ruined cities the player sees and the still functioning machines that impede their path.Not all of this white-robed culture died, though. A final glyph reveals that the remaining few went back to the mountain from whence they came.The player, meanwhile, is part of an endless cycles of many players journeying to and flying back from the mountain, a progression that makes some players act as newcomers, slowly finding their way, while others become mentors and guides having already found it.GameplayLooks like we're in for a long trip.Journey is a third-person adventure game where players play as a mysterious robed being who embarks on a journey to a mountain that emanates light from its peak.The player has three distinct modes of interaction. First, they can chirp or shout. By pressing or pressing and holding the circle button, the player creates a bubble of influence and a tone specific to that journeyer. This tone allows the player to communicate with another journeyer. If one journeyer shouts near another, the shout will replenish the other player's jumping ability. Also, shouts can refresh old cloth and scarves throughout the game, giving life to the sentient cloth.Second, they can fly. In Journey, players can jump and glide through the air, but only as long as their scarf will let them, as it designates how long one can stay airborne. When the player's scarf is lit and its symbols are showing, the player can press or hold the cross button to fly. The scarf can be lengthened, and thus strengthened, by collecting glowing symbols hidden throughout the environments. Besides interaction with other players, the scarf can be replenished through refreshed cloth, that which is also glowing and showing its symbols, and, later, through a mystic, water-like aura. This fact allows players to climb vertically indefinitely until the cloth or aura ends.Third, they can run or slide. Basic movement on the left analog stick makes the character run. Desert sand can slow the player on an uphill, or quicken them on the downhill. Certain sections of the game revolve around continuous sliding downhill, while feels like a snowboarding game.Journey tasks the player with solving puzzles to move on to the the next area. Environments are open, but strong winds keep players on the right track. Most puzzles involve freeing old cloth so that it opens up the path for the player. Players are also tasked with avoiding enemies with visible spotlights, as being caught in the light will fling the player and damage their scarf.MultiplayerWork together... or don't.Journey is considered unique when it comes to multiplayer, as it doesn't ask players if they want to play with others. It forces co-op onto the player by making them meet with other players at random. The game sees what level the player is on and inserts another player who's on the same level into their game. When another player enters, a white light will appear on the sides of the screen to lead the player to that other person if they want to join them. The only way not to play with others is to log off PSN while playing.Players can work together by giving each other boosts of power, huddle together for warmth, or simply guide one another across the vast landscape. There is no way to hinder other players.Players can only encounter others after the first area of the game, which becomes a level select hub after completion. Players can stay with each other throughout the entire journey if they wish. Doing so requires entering between level loads with that partner.During the journey, the player will usually be unaware of who they are playing with. It is possible to play with friends if both enter the same area at the same time, but this involves out-of-game communication. Within the game, players only learn the PSN IDs of their companions after the credits, when the PSN IDs appear in chronological order. Players can only communicate by using the circle button to emit sounds. The longer the button is held down, the louder the note will be.References to Past thatgamecompany GamesflOwOne of the cellular lifeforms from flOw can be found hidden in the temple in the sixth level. Finding the life form unlocks the trophy Ancestors.FlowerA flower can be found in between two sand dunes in the third level. Finding the flower unlocks the trophy Mirage.New Game+When the player completes their first journey, more embroidery appears on their robe. The more journeys the player takes, the more covered their robe becomes.The first area becomes a chapter select and bonus tracking hub. The player can go to any of the 7 levels by entering the shrines for each. In each shrine are the glyphs or empty frames where they would be, depending on whether the player has found them. Also in the hub is an open-air ruin that records all the scarf-lengthening symbols the player has found.Additionally, while the player's scarf does not retain its length between playthroughs, if the player collects every symbol, they unlock a circle of white, vertical scarves behind the area that records symbol collection. If the player enters this circle, their robe goes from red to white. White-robed players' scarves refill with power whenever they are on the ground, making their flying ability essentially unlimited. Players can reenter the circle to return to the red robe.ReceptionJourney has achieved both commercial and critical success. It currently holds the record as the fastest selling game ever released on PlayStation store. Journey has received universal acclaim, with a score of 92/100 on Metacritic.Journey was nominated for 11 D.I.C.E. Awards, and won in the following eight categories:Game of the YearOutstanding Achievement in Game Direction (Jenova Chen)Outstanding Achievement in Art DirectionOutstanding Achievement in Online GameplayOutstanding Innovation in GamingCasual Game of the YearOutstanding Achievement in Sound DesignOutstanding Achievement in Original Music CompositionJourney SoundtrackThe music was composed by Austin Wintory, He also did the soundtrack for another thatgamecompany game called flOw1.

1447450,Running Fable Demo,0,Seashell Studio,Seashell Studio,0,0,0,,English,,,"OverviewThe Hero as a young ladFable is a third person action RPG, set in the land known as Albion. In Albion, characters known as ""Heroes"" accept contracts filled out by the people of various towns and cities scattered across the land. You begin playing as a child who, through a twist of fate, becomes an orphan as the result of a bloody bandit raid. You are then then taken into the ""Heroes Guild"" by a man named Maze and begin your journey to becoming a hero. Your contracts will take you across the land where you will meet various people, either saving or killing them. As you become famous, you will eventually unearth a plot to destroy the world, and after an epic battle, you will have to decide whether or not to destroy the weapon in this plot, or keep its power for yourself. Fable has a unique good/evil system where your character will morph after time based on the actions that you take. For example, if you decide to go out of your way to kill every innocent bystander you see, eventually horns will grow out of your character's head and have a devilish presence about you. If you play morally, you will glow and may even have an angel's halo over your head. In October, 2005, Fable: The Lost Chapters, basically a special edition of the first game, expanded the first game by adding new areas to explore, weapons to fight with, monsters to challenge, armor to try on, and quests to complete. The additional quests continued the story of the original, while the expected technical changes like bugs being fixed made it the ultimate Fable experience on the original Xbox. The extra quests were not included in the Xbox Originals release of Fable.Cancelled Co-Op ModeA cancelled co-op mode would have allowed four players (one hero and three sidekicks) to be able to work together to complete unique quests. This feature was canceled in March 2004 due to limited time.PlotMaze, The Hero's MentorIn Fable, you play as a young lad who watches his entire village and family get murdered at the hands of bandits. Just as it seems you are about to meet a similar fate, a man by the name of "" Maze"" saves you and decides to take you in. As it turns out Maze is the head of a guild that trains people to becomes ""heroes"",after a few years in the guild your character is ready to go out into the world a hero, whether or not you decide to become a noble Savior to the downtrodden or a killer of thousands is up to you. As the game progresses, you learn that not all of your family was slain and that both your sister and mother are still alive, you also learn that your character is the last of a legendary bloodline that can unlock the power of an ancient sword, a sword that can destroy the world. After a heated battle between your character and Jack Of Blades, an evil character who seeks the destruction of the world for not worshiping him in the past, you can decide whether or not you want to keep the sword, at a great personal cost, or to cast it into oblivion.Main StoryAs stated earlier, Maze saves you from death and decides to take you in and train you to be a hero, as you arrive at the guild you are introduced to your roommate, Whisper, the much younger sister of Thunder, a renowned hero. Whisper greets you and says that she had never had to share her room before but she supposes she wouldn't mind. The next day you and Whisper head down to the training ring where the Guild Headmaster, not Maze, teaches you how to fight. He is less than disappointed with the effect your punches have on the target dummy and he tells you to try using a stick to whack the dummy into tiny bits of straw. You now easily destroy the straw figure with a few swings from your stick. After the dummy is destroyed, the Guild Headmaster teaches you how to defend yourself, with Whisper attacking you. After you successfully block a few of Whisper's attacks, her older brother Thunder happens to walk by and declares that his sister could easily defeat this ""Farm Boy"". The Headmaster thinks it would be good practice and he lets you and Whisper fight, if you defeat Whisper her brother scolds her and tells her to train harder before walking off. After Thunder walks off, an alarm bell begins to sound, the headmaster tells you that beetles are running amok in the guild forest and that it would be good practice for you to go out to the forest and deal with them. After you have slain the beetles the headmaster tells you that your true training is about to begin and that you should rest for tomorrow will be an busy day. You resume control of your character a few years later.Teenage HeroJust as you are getting out of bed, Whisper taunts you and says that you are going to be late for the Headmaster's tasks. As you arrive at the riverbank to talk to the headmaster he decides to train you in two other forms of combat, archery and Will. You will learn how to shoot the bow and how to perform the lightning bolt spell before the day is over. Finally, after you complete the headmaster's tests he tells you that you are almost done with your training and soon you will be a real hero. Again you resume control of your character after a few years.You awaken to the Headmaster telling you that Maze wanted to see you in the guild forest for a final test, as you arrive Maze appears in a cloud of blue smoke and tells you to show him what you have learned all these years. He tests you in the three forms of combat, melee, archery, and will before he tells you to go the guild for your graduation ceremony. You and Whisper are the only two who graduate at this time and after Maze and the Headmaster deliver a speech you and Whisper are presented with your medals, and are explained the importance of your role in Albion. After the graduation ceremony is over, you are given your first quest; to stop a rampaging group of wasps in the picnic area right outside of the Guild. As you arrive you see peasants running in fear as giant wasps chase after them and sting them to death. You promptly jump into the fray and after a few moments all that is left of the wasps are broken husks and wings on the ground. Unfortunately, just as the last wasp hits the ground, an angry buzzing noise fills the air and the Queen of Wasps flies down into the clearing to deal with you. It is a long fight but soon you stand triumphant over the corpse of the wasp queen. You receive a hefty sum of money as well as the wasp queen's head for finishing this quest.After you head back to the guild, you receive a message that Maze is waiting for you at an inn in the town of Bowerstone. Maze lightly jokes with you as you arrive, saying that he thought you might be too famous after killing the wasp queen to talk to him any more. Maze quickly becomes serious as he explains that there might be survivors in your family from the raid on Oakvale and that there were rumors that your sister, now blind, was working for the bandit Twinblade as a seer. Maze tells you that the entrance to the bandit camp is on the coast of Oakvale, but that you must be stealthy to gain entrance to the bandit camp. After you sneak into the camp you learn that you must have a pass to go into the inner sanctum of the bandit camp and that the only way to get it is to either pay a bandit 1,000 gold or win it off of a traveling merchant in the area. After you gain entry to the inner camp you run into yet another problem, no one is allowed into Twinblade's area except for the female hostages the bandits are keeping. Seeing no other option you kill the guard outside the hostage's cage and set them free, every bandit in the immediate area rushes after them and you are free to entry Twinblade's tent. As you slide through the massive oaken doors, you see Twinblade as well as a large group of bandits jeering at you. Twinblade says that his seer had told him that a guild-puppet would come and here you are. After a large battle you have the option of finishing Twinblade off or letting him live, either way your sister finally makes an appearance and tells you of her past, of the hardships she has endured and the things she has endured. Almost as soon as she makes an appearance she vanishes again, but not before unlocking a power hidden deep inside of you.As you head back to the Guild, you get a message from your sister, to meet her at the Grey House. As you arrive, she hands you a book and a piece ofArchery Skillparchment and quickly vanishes. As you read the book, you learn that you are the last of the bloodline of the Archon, the first king to rebel against the tyranny of the court of the blades. The Archon had managed to free the people from the court of blades with the help of the Sword of Aeons, a sword he stole from the Jack of Blades. The sword had a strange effect on the King though, he rapidly began to lose interest in his kingdom and he let his children run rampant through the world destroying whatever they wanted. In the later stages of his life, the King realized what had happened and with great sorrow he fled from the throne, hiding the sword and vanishing from the world. As a member of the Archon's family, you have the ability to unlock the power of the sword and wield it, but you do not know the location of the sword so you don't think it is of too much consequence.Once again, you head back to the guild, this time you receive a quest to help slay a White Balverine in the village of Knothole Glade. As soon as you enter the village, the Balverine attacks and to your dismay your weapons have no effect on it. After a short time in the village though, one of the villagers comes forwards and says that the White Balverine was her husband, but not anymore. She gives you an item that adds the element of silver to your weapon and tells you to save her husband from what he has become. With the silver-attuned weapon the Balverine falls with ease. The villagers of Knothole Glade are so grateful that they sign you up for the arena competition that they host. After a few rounds of ever-strengthening enemies, the arena announces that Whisper and you will be fighting back to back in order to help each other survive. Together, you make it past the final monster of the arena and seem to have finally won. Yet, Jack of Blades suddenly appears out of nowhere and declares that there will be one more round, a fight to the death between you and Whisper. After a sudden fight, you have the option to either cut Whisper down or walk away from the fight. Once the arena is over, Jack of Blades comes to congratulate you on your strength as well as you give you the title of ""Arena Champion"". After he gives you the bauble that comes with being champion, he vanishes from sight.Balverines on the prowlSoon, you get another message from your sister saying that your mother is still alive and being held in one of Jack of Blade's prisons. After much searching and with the help of an explorer you find out that there is a secret entrance into the prison from the graveyard. Too bad the graveyard is filled with mindless undead at the moment. Regardless, you manage to push your way through the graveyard and into the prison and you manage to get your mother out of her cell. just as you are about to exit out into the cemetery, Jack of Blades appears and seals off the exit, he laughs triumphantly and summons minions to put your mother back in her cell and you in a new one.At the prison you are held in you and the other inmates have a race every year, the winner gets poetry read to him by the Warden of the prison. While the warden reads, you must try to find a key in one of his three diaries. The first time you had tried this you had failed and were condemned to spend another year languishing in the prison while Jack of Blades ran free. Yet this time, with some luck you manage to find the key. You start a massive jailbreak and escape with your mother in the ensuing chaos. This time no Jack of Blades is there to stop you, but instead he put a creature of enormous power, a Kraken. After you finish off the Kraken, your mother unlocks a power deep inside of you and tells you to head to a town in the frozen wastes, that there the sword is hidden, and that you must get it before Jack of Blades does.As you arrive at the town, you find a strange barrier denying you entrance into the area where the sword is hidden. Your mother tells you to return to the guild because she has found a book that tells you how to unlock the barrier. As you arrive at the base of the tower that your mother is staying in, you hear her scream from inside. You storm up the stairs just in time to see her vanish along with Jack of Blades. The headmaster sympathizes with the loss of your mother after you just got her back but he urges you to find the sword. He says that he can use the book to unlock the barrier and tells you to hurry back to the area. Once you arrive you see Maze using a spell to trap your sister with no sign of the sword in sight. Once he sees you he stammers out an explanation that Jack of Blades is using a spell to control your sister, she yells out that it is a lie. As you stand there thinking about what to do, Jack of Blades strikes you from behind and places you under the same cage spell that MazeYou chose your fateis using on your sister. He and Maze begin to talk about the real location of the sword and then Jack of Blades vanishes in another teleport spell. As Maze stares at where he once stood, your sister uses some magic of her own to dispel the cage surrounding you. You must now fight your mentor Maze, and a tough battle it is. Maze frequently teleports and uses an impressive ring of fire to blast you away. Yet in the end you stand over Maze's broken body. He stammers out an explanation of why he did it, that he fears death more than anything, but that you might have a chance to stop Jack. That you must stop him from activating the Focus Sites around Albion to find out the Sword's location. You begin to chase Jack through several portals he has made to the focus sites but to no avail, he manages to activate all of them and step through a portal to the sword's location. Just as you step through the portal you are shocked to find yourself back at the guild; but it isn't the guild you remember, this one is burnt and broken. With the headmaster lying up against the wall a few feet away. He tells you that you must follow Jack into the chamber of fate and stop him from getting the sword.As you enter the chamber of fate, you see a massive sword lodged into the ground with a green aura surrounding it, you also see that Jack is holding your mother by the neck and your sister is bound on the ground at his feet. He mocks your family and then slashes your mother's throat open. Her blood takes down the green aura surrounding the sword and Jack pulls it out of the ground laughing triumphantly. After an intense battle, you stand before you sister, the Sword of Aeons in your hand, and the portal that consumed the body of Jack of Blades to your right. Your sister tells you that you now face the ultimate choice, that you can cut her down with the Sword of Aeons and receive the power that Jack dreamed of having or you can cast the sword into oblivion. The choice is yours, and it is up to you to craft your own Fable.Combat SystemFable's combat system is reminiscent of a button masher, you press ""X"" to attack and ""Y"" to defend, if you move the left analog stick while holding down ""Y"" your character will dodge in whatever direction you are pushing the analog stick. As you score hits on enemies a meter will appear to the left of your screen, the combat multiplier. The combat multiplier determines how many points in each subcategory (Strength, Skill, and Will) you will get for performing an action in each respective category. For example, if you had no combat multiplier and performed a spell you would receive 1 Will point, whereas if you had a combat multiplier of 10 and performed that same spell you would receive 10 Will points. In order to continue to increase your combat multiplier you must continue hitting enemies without taking damage yourself. A common tactic as to to swing a Melee weapon multiple times and then roll-dodge to avoid an enemies attack. Of course, combat is given an extra dimension when enemies start to block your standard attacks. The best way to deal with an enemy who is blocking is to perform a ""flourish"", a flourish is a uniquely animated move that is able to break through any enemies' block. It can be performed after your combat multiplier reaches 2, It is ready to be used when your weapon starts to glow orange, once it does hit ""B"" to knock down any enemies in front of you. Be careful though, your character might take a moment to recover from the flourish at which point you are vulnerable to enemy attack.Experience OrbsJump FlourishExperience orbs are dropped off of slain enemies, they are green orbs that will cover the ground wherever you kill an enemy. Experience orbs are used to level up your character's various abilities categorized under Strength, Skill, and Will. You might remember that the combat multiplier will also give you points in each immediate category depending on what action you perform, melee is for Strength, shooting a bow is for Skill, and magic is for Will.After you collect enough experience orbs, you can go to the Heroes Guild to decide what you want to spend your points on. Strength contains physique, toughness, and health. Skill contains speed, dexterity, guile, and accuracy. Will contains various forms of magic including self- buffs, summonings, time magic, destructive magic, and healing. Whenever you select what category you want to level up in points from each immediate category will be used up, followed by general experience.Character GrowthAgingAs the player character levels up, signs of aging will become more evident. The player starts their journey as a young teen and would eventually finish it as an older character according to the different experiences in the game.Good/Evil systemA Good, Hailed HeroPerhaps the most unique aspect of Fable is its good/evil system. Your character will change based on the actions you take. If you decide to sacrifice someone to an evil god you will start to be known as an evil person, and the people in villages and towns will act as if you are a demon when you walk by them. Whereas if you save every person you come across who needs help, selflessly give of yourself, and donate to the church, people will cheer and applaud for you when you enter a town. Not only do the townsfolk react to your exploits out in the world but your body does as well, be evil and you will develop slanting eyes and horns will slowly protrude from your head, be as evil as possible and flies will start to follow you around. If you are good your character will have an innocent face and have a bright halo above their head, be as good as possible and butterflies will start to follow you around.Strength (Melee)Physique- Determines how much melee damage you inflict, allows use of heavy weapons.Health- Lengthens your health bar, plain and simple.Toughness- Reduces amount of health taken when struck by an attack.Skill (Ranged)Strength Attribute ScreenSpeed- Increases attack speed in combat.Accuracy- Improves damage dealt with ranged weapons (bow or crossbow).Guile- Allows you to sneak/steal better and opens up discounts with various traders.Will (Magic)Attack Spells- Used for offensive attacks on enemies (5 spells).Surround Spells- Used when overwhelmed by enemies or to help player (5 spells).Physical Spells- Protects hero from enemies, mainly defensive (6 spells).Magic Power- Lengths mana bar (just like Health attribute).Will SpellsSurround SpellsDrain Life is an evil spell that allows you to drain the health out of most enemies, and transfer it to the hero.Force Push is a neutral spell that allows the hero to push everyone surrounding him, weather it be allies or enemies.Slow Time is a neutral spell that allows the hero to slow down everyone and everything but the hero.Summon is a good spell that allows the hero to summon a wasp at first, however, when the wasp kills a stronger enemy, the summon will become that stronger enemy. A summon can not become a weaker monster .Turncoat is an evil spell that allows the hero to take control of any target.Physical SpellsAssassin rush is a neutral spell that allows the hero to quickly run behind the current target.Berserk is an evil spell that greatly increases the hero's strength, but it will also lower the hero toughness.Ghost Sword is a neutral spell that creates swords that are good at distracting enemies, however they do not do much damage.Heal Life is a good spell that allows the hero to restore his health, as well as any friendly characters near the caster.Multi Arrow is a neutral spell that allows the hero to fire several arrows at once.Physical Shield is a good spell that allows the hero to be surrounded by a barrier. When activated, the barrier constantly drains the hero's will, and damage will also be done to will. When the hero is out of will (or if the hero takes it off), the shield disappears.Attack SpellsBattle Charge is a neutral spell that makes the hero charge forward, knocking anyone he runs into down.Enflame is a neutral spell that attacks all enemies surrounding the hero with flame.Fireball is a neutral spell that allows the hero to throw a fireball at any targets. It can be charged up depending on level.Lightning is the first spell learned in the game, and can attack multiple enemies at the same time.Multi Strike allows the hero to attack multiple times with one strike with his current weapon.SoundtrackCD Album CoverThe original score for Fable was written and composed by Russell Shaw and Alan Wilson, with the exception of the first track, ""Fable Theme"", which was composed by the famous film composer Danny Elfman.Track #Song TitleRunning Time01Fable Theme03.2702Oakyale03.2503Darkwood04.1004Witchwood03.1005Lychfield Cemetery04.3106Summer Fields04.0407Bowerstone04.3408Arena02.0609Temple of Light02.3810Hobbes Cave03.5611Greatwood03.1512Guild05.2913Fresco Dome04.58Xbox OriginalsOn December 4, 2007, Fable became available on the Xbox 360's Xbox Originals download service for 1200 Microsoft Points.TriviaLionhead Studios codenamed this game ""Project Ego"" long before the name Fable was adapted.

1446280,Alice in Wonderland - a jigsaw puzzle tale,399,Mens Sana Interactive,Mens Sana Interactive,0,0,4,Casual,English,,,"Overview   The DS version differs greatly from the Wii and PC versions.     Alice in Wonderland was released on March 2, 2010 for the           Wii,          PC, and         Nintendo DS. While released simultaneously, the Wii/PC versions are significantly different from the Nintendo DS version. All versions of the game were developed by Etranges Libelluie and published by        Disney Interactive Studios. In addition to these versions, an       iPhone adaptation of Tim Burton's movie is planned for release later this year.Despite the low amount of reviews, the game was moderately well received. According to Game Rankings, the aggregate score for Alice in Wonderland on PC and Wii respectively is 73% and 74%, while the DS version scored a 79% aggregate from four different publications.GameplayWii/PC Version   Â The White Rabbit in the Wii version.   Â   Starring a variety of characters from the movie (e.g. the      White Rabbit, the     Mad Hatter,    Cheshire Cat), the Wii and PC versions are third person action adventure games. Taking advantage of the cast of characters, puzzles require the usage of a particular character's special ability. For example, the Cheshire Cat can turn invisible or even make previously hidden items visible. The ability to switch between characters at any time is imperative to solving the variety of puzzles.The game centers around protecting Alice. At times during the adventure, heart-shaped portals open and Red Queen soldiers attack. In these battles, the ability to switch between characters is still available, and repeated attacks can chain together to create combos or special moves. When enemies are killed, characters' abilities can be upgraded with ""impossible ideas."" Characters cannot die, but instead will lose all impossible ideas gained during the battle. After all impossible ideas are lost, Alice can be dragged into the portal, triggering a game over.DS Version   Â The DS version is controlled completely with the touch screen.The DS version differs not only in gameplay, but in art style. The game is much more cartoonish in nature, which critics agreed fit the style of this puzzle platformer. This game does share some aspects with the Wii and PC iterations. Specifically, the game does not star Alice, but rather a variety of other characters who can be switched out at any time.The game is controlled almost completely with the touch screen and stylus. Characters go where the stylus is tapped, including jumping over pits and climbing over obstacles. However, if Alice is unable to follow along, she indicates so by crying for help. At this point, the player must also tap on her to help her along. Special abilities are retained in the DS version, although they are different. The White Rabbit has the ability to control time, the Cheshire Cat can turn parts of the game invisible, and so on.Combat takes place against the Red Queen's minions. These cards come out of a portal, and then attempt to drag Alice into it. This is also controlled via the touch screen, with stylus swipes controlling the attack motions. After killing the minions, the player must escape by saving Alice before she is dragged into the portal.",,,,,,,,,

1446160,Toy Soldiers HD ,2999,"Signal Studios, Outer Heaven, Eden Industries",Accelerate Games,0,0,2,"Action, Simulation, Strategy","English, French, Italian, German, Spanish - Spain, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese - Brazil, Russian, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese",,,"Overview A zoomed-out view of a battlefield diorama Toy Soldiers is    Signal Studios' first developed video game released exclusively to    Xbox Live Arcade's 2010 spring program, the    Block Party. It is a tower defense style game that takes place in multiple    World War I-themed dioramas inside a bedroom. Each set has British and German armies battling against each other for supremacy. Each force has a set of tanks, machine guns, planes, and explosives that can be used to defend attacking forces or remove opposing weapons.Â In both single player and multiplayer, the player must fend off enemies who seek to invade the toy box. After a set number of units invade the box, the battle is lost and the player is forced to restart that particular mission. GameplayThe player can build, upgrade, repair, or most of the time control units. As with most strategy games, building, upgrading, and repairing each cost money. However, controlling weaponry and destroying enemy units awards you money, and killing many enemies quickly will award you even more money.Â  Â The multiplayer skirmishes are playable by two people in either split screen or over    Xbox Live. The players are able to create attack plans while simultaneously defending their own toy box from the opponent. Certain battlefields are more unit-focused, where the gameplay centers on movable units like tanks rather than the immobile turrets. Five maps are available to play on.Â Â Â The gameplay only offers theÂ possibility to change the controls to inverted inside tanks, planes and the gun placements leaving the general camera and sniper tower toÂ normal controls only.Â Â Â   CampaignThis mode generally follows a    tower defense approach, with access to playable units such as planes and tanks later on in the campaign.Â The campaign follows different scenarios named after real life World War I battles. Such as the Battle of Polygon Woods, or the Battle of Ancre. The campaign offers the perspective of the British army and later the Germans. The campaign levels consist mostly of holding off various enemy waves and sometimes resolving in a boss fight. The bosses include the Tsar Tank,Â  a zeppelin, an ""Uber Tank"" and a giant rail-gun. Bosses can destroy the toy box regardless of enemies invaded.Â Four levels of difficulty are available, from casual to elite. The hardest difficulty forces the player to directly control their units one at a time, but with more lenient victory conditions. Â Â Players are awarded ration ticket items such as cigarettes and coffee for completing bonus objectives in each level. These items are displayed in the menus, but do not give in-game bonuses.Â  Bosses:  Tsar Tank: A Russian prototype tank, which is well known for its unique shape and design. It is encountered in the trial game as a 'game-ending boss' (ie. you cannot defeat it, and it is intended to end the demo), and at the Nonne Bosschen woods, during the game. It is easily defeated by the Howitzer guns, and is extremely slow moving.  Zeppelin: The Zeppelin was used as a bomber in WWI and is fought in Fort Douaumont in the campaign. It slowly drifts towards the players base while dropping bombs. It is defeated using anti-air guns such as the Old Quick Flak, and the planes the player has access to. Unsurprisingly, crashing planes into the Zeppelin is effective, but due to the 'cooldown' period on planes, it is not necessary the best tactic. Uber Tank: The Uber Tank is a fictional German-made tank, and resembles mobile artillery employed by the Nazis during World War II. It makes several laps of the battlefield, and should reach your toy box, it simply ploughs through and continues moving. It runs over player emplacements, meaning that tanks and artillery are good methods of destroying it. Along the flanks, the word 'Wotan!' can be seen. Rail Gun: The final boss, which represents the giant railway siege guns the Germans were noted for in WWI and WWII. It is undoubtedly the hardest boss of the game, and is similar to the real life 'Big Bertha' siege gun that the Germans used during WWI. Units A full list of buildable units and their descriptions can be found   here.Â  Units are upgraded during gameplay, and the upgraded models of units are earned through completing missions.Â  Historical InaccuraciesToy Soldiers does not seek to be an incredibly accurate replication of actual battles from World War I, and as such, there are some anachronisms present. Vehicles employed in the battlefield are occasionally fictitious, and in some cases, are employed by the wrong European power. For example, the Tsar Tank is used by the Germans (and if Campaign  is completed, the British will also use it), though the tank was only ever used by the Russians. The 'Little Willie' tank also appears in the game, despite the fact only one of these vehicles was ever made, and the 'Big Willie' also appears in use by the Germans, despite being a British design. Avatar AwardsÂ Toy Soldiers has the following   avatar awards.Â   M 1917 Gas MaskÂ - Play the game.  PickelhaubeÂ - (Achievement:Â   Coffin Nails) Beat the campaign.Â Facebook IntegrationThe main menu of Toy Soldiers contains a map of contributors to the    Facebook-powered Toy Soldiers application, a Bejeweled-like game where users can play as either the Allies or the Central Powers.",,,,,,,,,

1445540,The Chronicles of Moses and the Exodus,599,eFunSoft Games,HH-Games,0,0,0,Casual,English,,,"OverviewMetro Exodus is a post-apocalypse survival-based first-person shooter and is the third entry in the Metro series. Unlike the two games before it, Metro Exodus features more of an open-world structure across several different areas.StoryFollowing the events of Metro: Last Light, Artyom becomes disillusioned with the political and social structures in the metro system and beings making regular excursions to the surface with a radio to search for outside broadcasts from other survivors. He begins hearing faint signals, but is unable to clearly receive the messages.On one such excursion, Artyom and his wife Anna witness a train traveling along a railway and are apprehended by soldiers from Hansa, one of the major metro civilizations and an adversary of the Spartan Order to which the two belong. During their escape, the two accidentally disable a radio jammer that had secretly been blocking outside broadcasts from reaching Moscow, causing a flood of messages from around the world to pour in.With the help of Yermak, himself a disillusioned Hansa resident, Artyom and Anna escape aboard the train and are nearly captured again when Colonel Miller and his Spartans intercept and save them. Miller reveals he knew about the radio jammers. According to Miller, the war that destroyed the world is still ongoing, justifying the jammers as a way to isolate and protect Moscow. The Spartans discuss returning to the metro to reveal this truth to its residents, but believing that Hansa will have them executed for what they've done, decide the only course of action is to proceed towards the Ark, where the last remnants of Russia's government is believed to be holed up.GameplayMuch like the previous two games, Metro Exodus has a strong emphasis on survival mechanics. While exploring, players must be mindful of their supply of ammunition, healing supplies, and other items like air filters and throwables.CombatIn his travels, Artyom encounters human and mutant enemies that can be engaged loudly or stealthily. Artyom carries with him a backpack that is used to change weapon attachments and to craft simple items. Every weapon in the game can be outfitted with a variety of barrels, stocks, optics, magazines, and laser sights. These are acquired by dismantling weapons found in the environment or on dead enemies. Every weapon the player picks up is permanently added to Artyom's collection back at the train. The train is the only location where the player can change their equipped weapons aside from swapping them in the field.As a weapon is used, it will begin to accumulate dirt that will eventually cause it to start jamming. Weapons can be cleaned at workbenches found throughout each region. These workbenches also allow the player to craft ammunition and are often accompanied by a bed that allows the player to sleep till day or night.Radiation is less of an issue in Metro Exodus due to it taking place outside of Moscow, but there are still areas that necessitate the use of a gas mask. The air filter on the mask must be swapped every few minutes while in use. As the player takes damage, the mask may become damaged to the point where Artyom begins to suffocate. Holes in the mask can be quick-fixed in the field using tape, limiting the player's vision. Repairing the mask proper requires a workbench.ExplorationEach region of Metro Exodus is a self-contained open world environment with locations to explore. The player can use binoculars to identify locations to be marked on the map, such as bandit camps, ruined structures for looting, and safe houses. Some of the game's regions have vehicles to facilitate travel, such as a row boat or a van, as well as ziplines to allow for a quick and safe descent from tall structures. There is a day/night cycle that affects ease of stealth and in some cases the type of enemies in the environment, as well as a dynamic weather system.ExpansionsThe Two ColonelsAfter Artyom and Colonel Miller split up in Novosibirsk, Miller sets off alone into the Metro to find a satellite map detailing the location and radioactivity of Lake Baikal. He is guided over a radio by a young boy named Kirill, the lone survivor of a devastating war that took place in the city's Metro.The Two Colonels features the boy's father, Lieutenant-Colonel Slava Khlebnikov, as the protagonist during the final year of the Novosibirsk Metro's life. Khlebnikov, an officer in the station's OSKOM military police force, directs his men on excursions deep into the Metro to burn away an invasive organic slime that periodically spreads throughout the tunnels.Meanwhile, the station has begun running low on ""green stuff,"" an anti-radiation medicine that had been sustaining the Metro's population beneath the heavily radiated ruins of Novosibirsk. OSKOM begins confiscating excess supplies of ""green stuff"" from residents, causing discontent.Unable to solve the ""green stuff"" shortage, OSKOM announces an evacuation of the Metro. At the same time, a civil war erupts between the Metro's residents and OSKOM. During the battle, Khlebnikov witnesses OSKOM General Tolya releasing poison gas into the Metro. In the ensuing confrontation, Tolya reveals that enough ""green stuff"" remains to sustain OSKOM's leadership only, and the poison gas is their attempt to mercy kill the residents on their way out.General Toyla commits suicide after learning that the evacuation has left without him, and Khlebnikov survives the battle. Disillusioned with OSKOM and determined to save his son, he sets out into a bunker in the city ruins to find a the satellite map of Lake Baikal. He successfully retrieves the map, but succumbs to radiation poisoning shortly thereafter.One month later, Colonel Miller, having followed Khlebnikov's journey, finds the colonel's body and retrieves the map.Sam's StoryFollowing the end of Metro Exodus, the American member of the Spartans, Samuel Taylor, decides to leave the crew to pursue his dream of finding passage back to the United States to reunite with his father. He sets out alone in the crew's van and reaches Vladivostok.On the outskirts of Vladivostok, Sam encounters a Captain named Eduard Baranov, who points Sam to an operational nuclear submarine sitting in the harbor. Baranov was the commander of the submarine during the war that destroyed the world, and explains that he never allowed any of its missiles to fire.Sam is shortly thereafter captured by some men who take him to the submarine, where he meets another American named Tom. Tom has a plan to refuel the submarine and use its nuclear arsenal as power projection, promising to take Sam to San Diego if he helps accomplish this task.Sam ventures out into the ruins of Vladivostok with the help of Captain Baranov. The two are eventually successful in retrieving the fuel rods needed to power the submarine. On the way back, Baranov reveals that the fuel rods have a built-in self-destruct mechanism designed to eliminate any chance of the submarine being captured, and asks Artyom to consider detonating the charges to prevent Tom from having access to the craft's intact arsenal.Upon returning to the submarine, one of Tom's former subordinates, Krim, launches an attack. Krim had grown disillusioned with Tom's philosophy of power projection, believing instead that the nuclear weapons on board should be used offensively right away. Sam helps put down the attack as Tom and Captain Baranov sail out into the harbor.Depending on the player's choice, Sam can either board the submarine and travel to the United States, or detonate the fuel rods and sink it.Enhanced EditionMetro Exodus Enhanced Edition, free to all owners of the original game, was released for PC on May 6, 2021.

1444330,Beckoned Prototype Demo,0,Zade Studios,Zade Studios LLC,0,0,1,,English,,,"OverviewManhattan is your playground.Developed by Radical Entertainment and published by Sierra Entertainment and Activision, Prototype is an action game with a sandbox style of gameplay similar to Grand Theft Auto and Spider-Man. Set on Manhattan Island, players take control of protagonist Alex Mercer, a man with a mysterious past whose true nature is revealed through the course of the game. By performing various tasks in the game world, from story-driven quests to causing random destruction, players earn ""evolution points"" which may be spent on new abilities. These abilities range from simple stat upgrades to access to new shapeshifting forms.SynopsisA Shapeshifting WeaponThe game opens with Alex Mercer awaking in a morgue, the doctors having believed him dead. Struggling against a painful case of amnesia, Mercer escapes the morgue in search of his sister, Dana. Working with his sister and other allies, Alex seeks to uncover his powers' origins as well as stop a mysterious viral outbreak that has also appeared on the island.Unfortunately, Mercer is hindered by the United States military as well as the merciless Blackwatch. These black ops soldiers will stop at nothing to contain the virus and capture Mercer, even if it means destroying everyone and everything in their path. With martial law declared and an iron blockade isolating Manhattan, Alex has no choice but to confront both the viral monsters and the military forces at every turn, all the while uncovering the terrible secrets concerning the nature of the virus and the nature of his powers.GameplayTanks? No problem.Prototype iterates heavily on Radical Entertainment's 2005 superhero game, The Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction, with both sharing a focus on chaos and destruction. Locomotion is also similar, with both games' protagonists capable of running along the facades of skyscrapers and leaping hundreds of feet into the air. Augmenting Alex Mercer's superior running and jumping skills is his ability to "" auto parkour"". As long as he is running, obstacles in Alex Mercer's path are automatically leaped and flipped over, providing a single, fluid direction of movement regardless of the path taken.Prototype also introduces new stealth mechanics where players may literally consume other humans and take their form, using the disguise for both evasion and infiltration. The act of consuming another being also replenishes Mercer's biomass, effectively turning any person into a health boost. In certain points in the game, consuming another being does more than just replenish health. Alex Mercer may also absorb the memories, skills, and even the personality of his victim, allowing Mercer to uncover story elements, gain new skills, and improve existing ones.PowersCombine the blade and armor powers.Alex Mercer possesses a wide variety of abilities, many of which require manual activation by the player. These active powers are separated into categories. At any one time, Alex may simultaneously equip one offensive, defensive, and visual power. His disguise power, however, may only be simultaneously used with visual powers. Intelligent use of these abilities allows the player to conquer any obstacle the game presents.Miscellaneous PowersConsume - Alex can absorb the biomass of the humans he kills into his body, replenishing his health. Larger, inhuman enemies may also be partially consumed once weakened. Alex can also absorb the memories of some of the people he consumes; consuming specific targets may improve combat skills or provide insight into various story elements, also known as the ""Web of Intrigue"".Regeneration - If Alex is injured and no longer receiving damage, his body will automatically repair itself and slowly regain health.Strength - With superhuman strength, Alex can punch through armoured tanks and hurl the resulting husks at helicopters.Speed - Alex can sprint indefinitely through oncoming traffic and straight up the sides of buildings.Glide - When running isn't the best option, Alex produces invisible filaments extending from his arms and legs, allowing him to glide short distances.Devastator Abilities - By possessing sufficient biomass, Alex may turn his body into a weapon of even greater destruction, hurling his form as ground spikes, airborne tendrils, or a single pillar of death.Offensive PowersClaws - Each of Alex's fingers becomes a vicious claw. Although significantly more powerful than his fists, these weapons are still relatively weak in melee. However, they grant Alex the ability to send his claws underground, erupting violently underneath an opponent.Hammerfists - Alex shifts a great deal of biomass into his hands, transforming them into enormous bludgeons with which he can smash through the protection of armored targets or even turn himself into a human projectile.Whipfist - Alex's right arms transforms into an elastic, whip-like tendril with a terminal hook. The Whipfist is best used on multiple or distant opponents as well as latching onto distant obstacles and pulling them closer. Especially useful is its ability to latch onto helicopters to let Alex get close enough to steal them.Musclemass - Alex focuses his biomass into both his arms, drastically increasing his strength. While he no longer has access to special moves associated with other offensive powers, Alex's traditional combos and thrown objects now deal increased damage.Blade - One of the signature abilities. Alex's right arm transforms into a single elongated blade, deadly against both armoured and unarmoured opponents. Despite its shape, Alex is still able to grab and pick up people with it... somehow.Defensive PowersShield - Alex's left arm grows into a shield which extends to cover his front while he runs or locks onto a target, protecting him from damage. However, it can shatter if given enough punishment. It regenerates over time. It also disables his parkour abilities, in favour of holding the shield in front of him and smashing straight through obstacles.Armour Form - Alex's entire body becomes encased in an incredibly durable armour skin, reducing all received damage. Such increased mass, however, decreases Alex's mobility. He can no longer parkour or glide and his jumping ability is greatly diminished.Sensory PowersThermal Vision - Alex's visual senses attune to the infrared band, allowing him to more easily spot heat signatures through fog and smoke. Drawbacks include reduced visual range and a decrease in auditory feedback.Infected Vision - By connecting his mind to the viral hive mind that guides the infected, Alex sees the world as his enemy sees. Enemies become more brightly illuminated, and line of sight is no longer reduced. Auditory senses, however, are decreased to only a low rumbling at all times.Disguise AbilitiesDisguise - Alex shapeshifts into the form of the last healthy human he consumed (he cannot take the form of the Infected). Doing so has many applications, chiefly evading pursuers and using the shape of military personnel to infiltrate fortified military installations. If no alarm has been raised, Alex may even silently hijack vehicles without breaking cover.Stealth Consume - If no military personnel are watching, Alex may consume and take the form of an individual in one fluid motion without raising an alarm.Patsy - Only available while in military disguise, Alex accuses another soldier of being Alex Mercer, somehow instantly convincing surrounding allies to open fire on the luckless individual. This initially requires close contact with the victim, but can be upgraded to a simple point.Air Strike - Again only available in military disguise, Alex can radio in air support. Alex can only make so many calls, however, before he must consume a military commander to inexplicably restock the ability's uses.Vehicular SkillsJack Helicopters - Once Alex has consumed a helicopter pilot, he can steal choppers from their pilots by leaping onto them as they are flying through the air. He can then fly around freely and use the copter's full arsenal against his enemies.Jack Armour - Once Alex has consumed a tank driver, he can steal tanks and APCs by jumping onto them, wrenching open the lid and killing everybody inside. After that, he can freely ride around and he obtains full access to the tank's variety of guns and cannons.DevastatorDevastator attacks can only be performed when Alex is in 'Critical Mass'. In order to reach Critical Mass, Alex must consume enough humans or infected to overfill his health bar. The Devastator attack will relieve Alex of this over burden of health, and the results are usually worth it. Each of the devastator attacks has an Air version, purchased separately, that can be executed while jumping or falling.Groundspike Graveyard - A massive area of effect attack of spikes piercing out of the groundTendril Barrage - Alex becomes the center point for a large explosions of tendrils that damage everything they touch.Critical Pain - The only devastator which is a directed attack; appears to be a horizontal tornado coming out of Alex.PC System RequirementsOS: WindowsÂ® XP (with Service Pack 3) or Windows VistaÂ®Processor: IntelÂ® Coreâ¢2 Duo 2.6 GHz or AMD Athlonâ¢ 64 X2 4000 or betterMemory: Vista 2 GB RAM / XP 1 GB RAMGraphics: All NVIDIAÂ® GeForceÂ® 7800 GT 256 MB and better chipsets.

Tank! is a third-person vehicular combat game developed and released by Namco Bandai for arcades in late 2009 (October in Japan, December in North America).A spiritual sequel to the 1995 Namco arcade game Tokyo Wars, Tank! Tank! Tank! pits four players (human or A.I.) against each-other as quick-moving combat tanks in wide-open destructible arenas. Along with a variety of weapon power-ups (from a standard Machine Gun to the single-use Colossus Missile), the game features an optional co-operative mode where players fight a variety of giant monsters. The dedicated sit-down arcade machines (which are linked together) feature heavy use of force feedback and ""NAM-CAM"" camera support (for player avatars, previously a feature in the Mario Kart Arcade GP series).The game was later ported to the Wii U and released in two forms: one as a complete retail release and one as a downloadable free-to-play release (with DLC for levels and game modes). Along with local split-screen multiplayer for up to four players (with one player using the Wii U Gamepad), this version adds new maps, tank types, and game modes (including a Story Mode and an asymmetrical multiplayer mode using the Gamepad).The retail release was a launch title for the Wii U in North America and Europe (November 18, 2012 and November 30, 2012, respectfully), with the downloadable version released in early 2013. The Japanese version swapped release dates, with the downloadable version released on December 26, 2012 and the retail version in February 21, 2013.GameplayMultiplayer Gameplay.Each player controls a tank and can compete in 3 different game modes. Players control their tanks using a steering wheel and forward and reverse pedals. Both the seat and the steering wheel shake when firing a shot or being struck by one. The game includes multiple power ups for your tank, including the Plasma Bolt, Machine Gun, Missile Rack, Colossus Missile, and Mega-Beam. Before the start of each match, each player can have their picture taken by a camera included with the cabinet or the Wii U gamepad and choose one of many different costume overlays to include with it.ModesCo-op: All players work together to take down a series of giant monsters, culminating in a battle against King Ghidora-esque 3 headed robot dragon.Free-for-All: Players fight against each other in one of two different settings. The player who destroys the most tanks during the time limit wins.Team Battle: Players split up into two different teams and fight for supremacy.My Kong ( Wii U Only ): One player takes control of a large gorilla monster via use of the Gamepad while up to 3 other players using the standard tank attempt to destroy them.Wii UThe Wii U version of the game is played with the Wii U gamepad and Wii remotes. Tanks are controlled with the Wii remote. Players hold the remote horizontally in their hands, using the directional pad to move their tank around while hitting A to fire. Players lock on to their targets and can destroy the environment to dig up upgrades that increase their fire power or armor.In multiplayer, one player uses the Wii U gamepad to control the level's boss. The player uses the controller's screen to control their character and can tap the screen to unleash powerful attacks such as devastating stomps and barrages of missiles. The front facing camera of the controller lets players put their face into the game as the boss's face.",,,,,,,,,

The character initiates a battle by touching an enemy in the field screen and different situations occur depending on the area of contact. If the player manages to initiate the battle by touching the enemy from behind, the battle will begin with a Player Advantage and the enemies will be stunned for a shot period of time. However, if the enemy ambushes the player by initiating the battle by attacking the player from behind, the battle starts with an Enemy Advantage and all the enemies will have their Rush Gauge half filled at the start. A new battle mechanic is also introduced in this installment named Blindsides. If the player controlled character holds down the charge button and initiates a dodge right before an enemy attack, they will perform the deadly blindside maneuver. Blindsides automatically move the player behind the enemy and a 100% critical hit chance rate for the next few attacks.Bonus BoardWhen certain requirements are met in battle, tiles are awarded to the player's bonus board. Different colored tiles correlate to a different bonuses awarded at the end of battle:Blue Tile - Awarded when a player defeats an enemy with a critical hit. Awards the player with 10% extra experience.Yellow Tile - Awarded when a player defeats multiple enemies at once. Awards the player with 10% fol.Green Tile - Awarded when a player is ambushed. Awards the player with extra 1 party SP.Pink Tile - Awarded when a player defeats an enemy only using skills. Awards the player with 1% HP and MP recovery.Bonus board tiles stack so it is player advantageous to collect as many tiles as possible. It is possible to lose tiles, however, if the player controlled character dies or the character receives a critical hit. In this situation the player loses half of their connected tiles of each color ie: if you have fourteen connected blue tiles you end up with seven. It is advantageous to earn bonus tiles in such a way as all tiles are connected to one or more others of the same color, as non-paired tiles will always be lost.ReceptionCurrent reviews of Star Ocean: The Last Hope have ranged in the 50 to 90 range. Critics have noted that occasionally weird dialog and long cutscenes hurt the story, as well as having no option to turn on Japanese voice-overs. Reviewers have been more comfortable with the soundtrack, combat, levelling, framerate, and the sheer size of the game, however. Note that this is a 3 disc game. It does a decent job at limiting disc swaps. Near the end of the game you have access to a teleporter to travel around to the locations you've previously visited, and disc swapping is required here.Star Ocean: The Last Hope InternationalStar Ocean: The Last Hope International is an enhanced port of the formerly Xbox 360 exclusive Star Ocean: The Last Hope for Playstation 3. It features new additional content, Japanese and English voice tracks and two sets of character portraits.",,,,,,,,,

Glory of the Roman Empire will challenge gamers to grow a small village into a thriving community through trade with neighbors, while also expanding and defending its borders through more militaristic means.

1443430,Rogue,299,"Epyx, Inc.",Pixel Games UK,0,0,0,"Adventure, RPG, Strategy",English,,,"OverviewOriginally developed around 1980 on the UNIX operating system, Rogue became popular on college systems throughout the early 1980s. The original authors of Rogue were Michael Toy, Glenn Wichman and Ken Arnold. Because of the game's success, Michael Toy and Jon Lane ported the title to IBM PC, and later it was ported to Macintosh by Michael Toy. The franchise's marketing was eventually handed over to publisher Epyx, who Amiga, Atari ST and CoCo versions. Further ports were handled by Mastertronic in 1988 for AMSTRAD CPC, Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum computers.GameplayRogue is the quintessential fantasy dungeon crawler, sending the player down through many levels on a quest to recover the Amulet of Yendor (Rodney backwards), and return with it to the surface. Since the levels become increasingly more challenging, completing the game is notoriously difficult. The game's original graphics consist solely of ASCII; the player character is represented on screen by the ""@"" symbol; this was changed to ""âº"" in a later port. As well as this, different letters and symbols represent different enemies, items, and the environment. Later versions added sprite-based graphics, but ASCII graphics are most commonly associated with Rogue.Movement is made with the arrow keys, however earlier versions used ""HJKL"" as the main controls. There are also single key presses for actions such as ""quaff"" (Q), ""eat"" (E), and ""wield"" (W). Each level contains a maximum of nine rooms, with some rooms being replaced with a dead-end corridor.The key is to balance exploration with progression, too much exploring can waste food and risk loss of health to monsters; too much focus on progression and important items may be missed.Rog-O-MaticDeveloped in 1981 as part of a research paper by four university students, Rog-O-Matic is a bot designed to automatically play through Rogue. The bot is capable of consistently beating runs of the game, and would inspire a number of later bots designed for other games and uses.",,,,,,,,,

The game released on September 25th 2020 for PC, Xbox One and PlayStation 4.Mafia: Definitive Edition is a remake of the original Mafia, which originally released in 2002. It also served as the final addition to the Mafia Trilogy, a collection which includes remasters of Mafia II and Mafia III.StoryThe game begins in 1938. Detective Norman arrives at a bar on Central Island to interrogate Thomas Angelo, a former capo in the Salieri crime family who has been marked for death. Tommy agrees to disclose his history with Don Salieri, as well as some information, in return for the protection of him and his family.Prior to having any involvement with organized crime, Tommy was a taxi cab driver during the early years of the Great Depression. Although the hours were long and the pay was low, Tommy was grateful to be employed during a time of financial crisis where many people were suffering. One night in 1930, while Tommy was on his shift, he witnesses a car shootout between gangsters of two rival families: Salieri and Morello. Two of Salieri's trusted men called Paulie & Sam hold Tommy at gunpoint and order him to evade the pursuing cars. After Tommy successfully escapes from the prevalent gang war, Sam tells Tommy to head to Little Italy. Paulie and Sam head into Salieri's bar, and Sam returns to give Tommy money to compensate for the damage done to his car. Soon afterwards, Tommy realizes that he's been paid much more than he expected and begins to take an interest to the criminal lifestyle.The following day, Tommy takes on various taxi fares across the city. Whilst on break, Tommy is attacked by two of Morello's men who tracked him down. Tommy breaks free from their grasp and a chase ensues. Making his way towards Salieri's bar, Tommy regroups with Paulie and Sam, who threaten Morello's thugs to leave. Shortly afterwards, Sam decides to introduce Tommy to Don Salieri.During a sit down, Salieri offers to give Tommy a loan which will cover the damages done to his taxi cab. While Tommy is thankful for this offer, he makes it clear that he wants to get revenge on the men who attacked him. With Paulie's help, Salieri allows Tommy to smash up some of the cars parked in the garage of Morello's bar. Afterwards, Paulie introduces Tommy to Ralph - the mechanic and locksmith of the Salieri family with a noticeable stutter, and Vincenzo - Salieri's gunsmith who like to  show-off. ",,,,,,,,,

1443120,Beckoned Prototype,0,Zade Studios,Zade Studios LLC,0,0,0,"Indie, RPG",English,,,"OverviewManhattan is your playground.Developed by Radical Entertainment and published by Sierra Entertainment and Activision, Prototype is an action game with a sandbox style of gameplay similar to Grand Theft Auto and Spider-Man. Set on Manhattan Island, players take control of protagonist Alex Mercer, a man with a mysterious past whose true nature is revealed through the course of the game. By performing various tasks in the game world, from story-driven quests to causing random destruction, players earn ""evolution points"" which may be spent on new abilities. These abilities range from simple stat upgrades to access to new shapeshifting forms.SynopsisA Shapeshifting WeaponThe game opens with Alex Mercer awaking in a morgue, the doctors having believed him dead. Struggling against a painful case of amnesia, Mercer escapes the morgue in search of his sister, Dana. Working with his sister and other allies, Alex seeks to uncover his powers' origins as well as stop a mysterious viral outbreak that has also appeared on the island.Unfortunately, Mercer is hindered by the United States military as well as the merciless Blackwatch. These black ops soldiers will stop at nothing to contain the virus and capture Mercer, even if it means destroying everyone and everything in their path. With martial law declared and an iron blockade isolating Manhattan, Alex has no choice but to confront both the viral monsters and the military forces at every turn, all the while uncovering the terrible secrets concerning the nature of the virus and the nature of his powers.GameplayTanks? No problem.Prototype iterates heavily on Radical Entertainment's 2005 superhero game, The Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction, with both sharing a focus on chaos and destruction. Locomotion is also similar, with both games' protagonists capable of running along the facades of skyscrapers and leaping hundreds of feet into the air. Augmenting Alex Mercer's superior running and jumping skills is his ability to "" auto parkour"". As long as he is running, obstacles in Alex Mercer's path are automatically leaped and flipped over, providing a single, fluid direction of movement regardless of the path taken.Prototype also introduces new stealth mechanics where players may literally consume other humans and take their form, using the disguise for both evasion and infiltration. The act of consuming another being also replenishes Mercer's biomass, effectively turning any person into a health boost. In certain points in the game, consuming another being does more than just replenish health. Alex Mercer may also absorb the memories, skills, and even the personality of his victim, allowing Mercer to uncover story elements, gain new skills, and improve existing ones.PowersCombine the blade and armor powers.Alex Mercer possesses a wide variety of abilities, many of which require manual activation by the player. These active powers are separated into categories. At any one time, Alex may simultaneously equip one offensive, defensive, and visual power. His disguise power, however, may only be simultaneously used with visual powers. Intelligent use of these abilities allows the player to conquer any obstacle the game presents.Miscellaneous PowersConsume - Alex can absorb the biomass of the humans he kills into his body, replenishing his health. Larger, inhuman enemies may also be partially consumed once weakened. Alex can also absorb the memories of some of the people he consumes; consuming specific targets may improve combat skills or provide insight into various story elements, also known as the ""Web of Intrigue"".Regeneration - If Alex is injured and no longer receiving damage, his body will automatically repair itself and slowly regain health.Strength - With superhuman strength, Alex can punch through armoured tanks and hurl the resulting husks at helicopters.Speed - Alex can sprint indefinitely through oncoming traffic and straight up the sides of buildings.Glide - When running isn't the best option, Alex produces invisible filaments extending from his arms and legs, allowing him to glide short distances.Devastator Abilities - By possessing sufficient biomass, Alex may turn his body into a weapon of even greater destruction, hurling his form as ground spikes, airborne tendrils, or a single pillar of death.Offensive PowersClaws - Each of Alex's fingers becomes a vicious claw. Although significantly more powerful than his fists, these weapons are still relatively weak in melee. However, they grant Alex the ability to send his claws underground, erupting violently underneath an opponent.Hammerfists - Alex shifts a great deal of biomass into his hands, transforming them into enormous bludgeons with which he can smash through the protection of armored targets or even turn himself into a human projectile.Whipfist - Alex's right arms transforms into an elastic, whip-like tendril with a terminal hook. The Whipfist is best used on multiple or distant opponents as well as latching onto distant obstacles and pulling them closer. Especially useful is its ability to latch onto helicopters to let Alex get close enough to steal them.Musclemass - Alex focuses his biomass into both his arms, drastically increasing his strength. While he no longer has access to special moves associated with other offensive powers, Alex's traditional combos and thrown objects now deal increased damage.Blade - One of the signature abilities. Alex's right arm transforms into a single elongated blade, deadly against both armoured and unarmoured opponents. Despite its shape, Alex is still able to grab and pick up people with it... somehow.Defensive PowersShield - Alex's left arm grows into a shield which extends to cover his front while he runs or locks onto a target, protecting him from damage. However, it can shatter if given enough punishment. It regenerates over time. It also disables his parkour abilities, in favour of holding the shield in front of him and smashing straight through obstacles.Armour Form - Alex's entire body becomes encased in an incredibly durable armour skin, reducing all received damage. Such increased mass, however, decreases Alex's mobility. He can no longer parkour or glide and his jumping ability is greatly diminished.Sensory PowersThermal Vision - Alex's visual senses attune to the infrared band, allowing him to more easily spot heat signatures through fog and smoke. Drawbacks include reduced visual range and a decrease in auditory feedback.Infected Vision - By connecting his mind to the viral hive mind that guides the infected, Alex sees the world as his enemy sees. Enemies become more brightly illuminated, and line of sight is no longer reduced. Auditory senses, however, are decreased to only a low rumbling at all times.Disguise AbilitiesDisguise - Alex shapeshifts into the form of the last healthy human he consumed (he cannot take the form of the Infected). Doing so has many applications, chiefly evading pursuers and using the shape of military personnel to infiltrate fortified military installations. If no alarm has been raised, Alex may even silently hijack vehicles without breaking cover.Stealth Consume - If no military personnel are watching, Alex may consume and take the form of an individual in one fluid motion without raising an alarm.Patsy - Only available while in military disguise, Alex accuses another soldier of being Alex Mercer, somehow instantly convincing surrounding allies to open fire on the luckless individual. This initially requires close contact with the victim, but can be upgraded to a simple point.Air Strike - Again only available in military disguise, Alex can radio in air support. Alex can only make so many calls, however, before he must consume a military commander to inexplicably restock the ability's uses.Vehicular SkillsJack Helicopters - Once Alex has consumed a helicopter pilot, he can steal choppers from their pilots by leaping onto them as they are flying through the air. He can then fly around freely and use the copter's full arsenal against his enemies.Jack Armour - Once Alex has consumed a tank driver, he can steal tanks and APCs by jumping onto them, wrenching open the lid and killing everybody inside. After that, he can freely ride around and he obtains full access to the tank's variety of guns and cannons.DevastatorDevastator attacks can only be performed when Alex is in 'Critical Mass'. In order to reach Critical Mass, Alex must consume enough humans or infected to overfill his health bar. The Devastator attack will relieve Alex of this over burden of health, and the results are usually worth it. Each of the devastator attacks has an Air version, purchased separately, that can be executed while jumping or falling.Groundspike Graveyard - A massive area of effect attack of spikes piercing out of the groundTendril Barrage - Alex becomes the center point for a large explosions of tendrils that damage everything they touch.Critical Pain - The only devastator which is a directed attack; appears to be a horizontal tornado coming out of Alex.PC System RequirementsOS: WindowsÂ® XP (with Service Pack 3) or Windows VistaÂ®Processor: IntelÂ® Coreâ¢2 Duo 2.6 GHz or AMD Athlonâ¢ 64 X2 4000 or betterMemory: Vista 2 GB RAM / XP 1 GB RAMGraphics: All NVIDIAÂ® GeForceÂ® 7800 GT 256 MB and better chipsets.

1443023,Forza Horizon 4: 1968 Ford Mustang GT 2+2 Fastback,299,Playground Games,Xbox Game Studios,0,0,0,Racing,"English, French, Italian, German, Spanish - Spain, Czech, Hungarian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese - Brazil, Russian, Simplified Chinese, Spanish - Latin America, Traditional Chinese, Turkish",,,"OverviewThe car featured on the game's box art: the 2015 Lamborghini HuracÃ¡n Forza Horizon 2 is a open-world racing game developed by Playground (in conjunction with Turn 10 and Sumo Digital) and published by Microsoft for the Xbox One and Xbox 360 on September 30, 2014.The sequel to the first game in Playground's spin-off Forza Motorsport series, Forza Horizon 2 brings the fictional Horizon Festival event to Europe (namely Southern France and Northern Italy) with a much larger drivable area (nearly triple the size of the original game), larger player lobbies, more events, and new challenges.While the Xbox 360 version of the game (developed primarily by Sumo Digital) runs on the same game engine as the original, the Xbox One version features the enhanced engine that powered Forza Motorsport 5, adding an enhanced dynamic weather system, fewer barriers on the road (for a more free-roaming off-road experience), and the ""Drivatar"" system (where the AI of each opponent car are based on the style of a particular player).In addition to numerous DLC packs (now including larger Expansions with new locales and challenges), the game received a standalone expansion and promotional tie-in with the 2015 film Furious 7. Titled Forza Horizon 2 presents Fast & Furious, it was made free-to-download for the first few weeks of its launch.GameplayForza's precision game play out on the open roadProject Gotham Racing lives on in a way in Horizon 2. Playground tweaked the Skills system of the first game, so that it's more front and center and rewards the player for things other than winning, such as stylish driving. There is also a new Perk system, earned through the Skills system, allowing players to gain XP faster among other benefits.Filling this new world are over 700 events, and an estimated 100 hour commitment to getting 100% completion. Cross country races, one of the new event types, sound a lot like Burnout Paradise's point to point races allowing participants to ignore the generated GPS route and take any way they want to the finish line. Another new event, The Bucket List, involve finding specific cars parked in the world and getting in them for a unique challenge. These Bucket List challenges are updateable post launch, so Playground can constantly fill the world new ones (presumably including DLC cars).Forza Horizon 2 will support a maximum of 12 players online. That's up from the 8 that Horizon 1 and Forza 5 support. As with many other games in this new generation Horizon has a seamless link between single player and multiplayer. Car clubs make a return once again and will support up to 1000 people. Car Meets, a new feature, lets players meet a specified location to simply check out each others cars, or for more granular things like share tunes, liveries, and cars. Car Meets will also serve as a sort of in game lobby for setting up events.The game is based on the technology Turn 10 created for Forza Motorsport 5, including drivatars. Horizon 2 will also feature a weather system, a first for the Forza franchise. In order to create the best lighting possible, Playground also claims to have recreated the Earth's atmosphere for life-like accuracy of the color of the sky.Downloadable ContentYou can never have too many cars.The Xbox One version of the game received numerous downloadable content (both paid and free) throughout 2014 and 2015.Along with Expansions and simple Car Packs, the game includes three bonus DLC options:Car Pass, which is a season pass that includes six Car Packs at a discount, with a bonus car (the 2010 Noble M600).VIP Membership, which includes five cars, exclusive multiplayer events, and a permanent 2x bonus to Credits earned.Treasure Map, which highlights every collectible on the in-game map.In addition, players can also purchase Tokens using real-world money, which can be used towards cars, upgrades, and ""game accelerators"".Car PacksEach Car Pack unlocks a variety of cars, all of which require no in-game currency on their first purchase.

1442600,Epicinium - Extended Soundtrack,0,A Bunch of Hacks,A Bunch of Hacks,0,0,0,,,,,"OverviewEpicinium is an indie strategy game inspired by Advance Wars with an environmental twist; combat can destroy the forests that cities rely on to grow and global warming leads to extreme temperatures that prevent crops from growing. Players can use the destructive abilities of their units to overwhelm opponents and cripple economies, or try a more subtle approach in order to preserve the region that they are capturing. At the end of the game, the winner is scored for the number of grass and forest tiles still left on the map.GameplayEach round, players simultaneously give up to five orders to their units and buildings in the planning phase. In the action phase, these orders are played out; first an order of player 1, then an order of player 2, etcetera, until there are no more orders to execute. Units might miss because their target has moved away, or die before they even get to execute their order. Therefore, anticipating your opponent's orders is key to winning small skirmishes.Between rounds, either a weather phase takes place in which the season changes and temperatures rise of fall, or a night phase takes place. At night, cities and other structure tiles gain power and generate income, provided that their surroundings still support their growth. Cities and towns require grass, water or crops to grow, so a town surrounded by dirt and rubble is useless.Over time, global warming increases the fluctuations in temperature that occur when seasons change. Extreme temperatures and extreme drought can prevent crops from growing, cause units to be more vulnerable to damage, or even outright destroy entire cities. Building industry accelerates this process but also unlocks powerful units that might help win the game before the destruction gets out of hand.",,,,,,,,,

1442810,Anno 1800 - Land of Lions,1799,Ubisoft Mainz,Ubisoft,0,0,0,"Simulation, Strategy","English, French, Italian, German, Spanish - Spain, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Russian, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese",,,"DescriptionAnno 1800 is the seventh main iteration of the city building simulation game, not counting spin-offs, developed by German studio Blue Byte. The game focuses primarily on workforces and the budding technological advancements of colonial times, from farming to factory work.As with previous installations in the series, the goal is to colonize a series of islands, meet the needs of a growing and more demanding population, while eventually expanding to other settlements. Every island has a certain amount of fertile grounds for specific products, which enables a trading mechanism. Fertility can differ on the starting map, called The Old World, and a second map, South America.There are three main segments in Anno 1800: A campaign, a sandbox mode and a multiplayer option that holds up to four players.CampaignAnno 1800 has a campaign that spans four chapters. The story revolves around a family business, where the death of the patriarch sets off a power struggle. The player protagonist is cast out in a family argument with their uncle, Edvard Goode. Players erect a competing business on a separate island and attempt to work off a funeral debt in the first chapter.WorkforceA primary gameplay element in Anno 1800 is the separate, specific workforces that each production building requires. There are five tiers in total:FarmersWorkersArtisansEngineersInvestorsThe tiers each originate from the Farmerâs Residence building and can be upgraded by meeting specific needs of stored products and a vicinity to services, like schools.Upgrading a tier removes the populace number from the previous tier. Workers do not perform Farmersâ duties and so on. This leads to having specific residences throughout the map, to service buildings of certain tiers.NewspaperAt certain intervals, a publisher will ask the player to print a newspaper that can affect the colonyâs happiness or needs. Three front page segments will affect the people in a positive or negative way. By using an influence score, the player can adjust one of the three articles, by replacing them with propaganda.AttractivenessAside from just meeting the needs of the people, Anno 1800 also balances an attractiveness system to get people to move in. There are positive and negative elements to attractiveness.Culture, Nature and Festivity contribute to a positive attractiveness score. Nature is the amount of open grounds and forests that are left on a certain island, while Festivity marks special events where the populace holds festivals and such. Culture can be built by placing ornaments or through the Zoo and Museum buildings, which can add more exhibition segments to their surroundings. The Zoo and Museum buildings are unlocked in the Artisan citizen tier.Vulgarity, Pollution and Instability lead to a negative attractiveness score. Vulgarity marks things like pig farms, while Pollution contains buildings like coal-powered factories. Instability scores are events like riots or epidemics that get triggered in settlements.ExpeditionsCertain expeditions chances can appear that require a boat from the playerâs fleet. Each expedition will have certain random events happen during it, which can be predicted beforehand in segments like Naval Power, Diplomacy, Hunting and so on. Boats can stock up on certain items to boost the effectiveness of these traits.Random events play out like choose-your-own-adventure games, where choices with certain success percentages are prompted.

1442811,Anno 1800 - Land of Lions Uplay Activation,,,,0,0,0,,,,,"DescriptionAnno 1800 is the seventh main iteration of the city building simulation game, not counting spin-offs, developed by German studio Blue Byte. The game focuses primarily on workforces and the budding technological advancements of colonial times, from farming to factory work.As with previous installations in the series, the goal is to colonize a series of islands, meet the needs of a growing and more demanding population, while eventually expanding to other settlements. Every island has a certain amount of fertile grounds for specific products, which enables a trading mechanism. Fertility can differ on the starting map, called The Old World, and a second map, South America.There are three main segments in Anno 1800: A campaign, a sandbox mode and a multiplayer option that holds up to four players.CampaignAnno 1800 has a campaign that spans four chapters. The story revolves around a family business, where the death of the patriarch sets off a power struggle. The player protagonist is cast out in a family argument with their uncle, Edvard Goode. Players erect a competing business on a separate island and attempt to work off a funeral debt in the first chapter.WorkforceA primary gameplay element in Anno 1800 is the separate, specific workforces that each production building requires. There are five tiers in total:FarmersWorkersArtisansEngineersInvestorsThe tiers each originate from the Farmerâs Residence building and can be upgraded by meeting specific needs of stored products and a vicinity to services, like schools.Upgrading a tier removes the populace number from the previous tier. Workers do not perform Farmersâ duties and so on. This leads to having specific residences throughout the map, to service buildings of certain tiers.NewspaperAt certain intervals, a publisher will ask the player to print a newspaper that can affect the colonyâs happiness or needs. Three front page segments will affect the people in a positive or negative way. By using an influence score, the player can adjust one of the three articles, by replacing them with propaganda.AttractivenessAside from just meeting the needs of the people, Anno 1800 also balances an attractiveness system to get people to move in. There are positive and negative elements to attractiveness.Culture, Nature and Festivity contribute to a positive attractiveness score. Nature is the amount of open grounds and forests that are left on a certain island, while Festivity marks special events where the populace holds festivals and such. Culture can be built by placing ornaments or through the Zoo and Museum buildings, which can add more exhibition segments to their surroundings. The Zoo and Museum buildings are unlocked in the Artisan citizen tier.Vulgarity, Pollution and Instability lead to a negative attractiveness score. Vulgarity marks things like pig farms, while Pollution contains buildings like coal-powered factories. Instability scores are events like riots or epidemics that get triggered in settlements.ExpeditionsCertain expeditions chances can appear that require a boat from the playerâs fleet. Each expedition will have certain random events happen during it, which can be predicted beforehand in segments like Naval Power, Diplomacy, Hunting and so on. Boats can stock up on certain items to boost the effectiveness of these traits.Random events play out like choose-your-own-adventure games, where choices with certain success percentages are prompted. Losing these events will lower the boatâs morale, which can lead to failure.Returning from a successful expedition can yield special items, like Zoo and Museum exhibitions or building specialists.FactionsThe map has a set of different settlements with their own factions located on it. Some parties are more receptive than others, as some start with trading possibilities opened. For others, the player will need to engage in diplomacy to unlock trading rights or alliances.

In addition, the game includes numerous DLC stages, most of which are recreations of stages from past games in the series.Like its predecessor, the game includes over 100 ships to choose from, each with their own unique weaponry. Unlike the original R-Type Final, in which most of the ships are unlocked through a tech-tree system, R-Type Final 2 combines a tech-tree system with a crafting system, as players earn resources through normal gameplay. Only half of the ships were made available in the game's release, with the remaining ships added through post-release updates (with the final one added on March 16, 2022). Three additional ships were made exclusive to certain crowdfunding backers through passwords, and some additional ships were added as DLC.The story further expands on the lore of ""Operation: Last Dance"", the counter-attack investigated in the game's predecessor.R-Type Final 2 was originally part of a Kickstarter campaign throughout 2019, receiving Â¥98,863,825 in funding (with an additional Â¥31,508,103 in two additional crowdfunding rounds).DLC StagesStage Pass Volume OneSet 1Released on game launch.Stage X1.0 - Flame-Engulfed Arms Factory - Based on the the 4th stage from R-Type III.Stage X2.0 - Inside of Ruins - Based on the 5th stage from R-Type Leo.Set 2Released on June 4, 2021.Stage X3.0 - Crazed Craft - Based on the 1st stage from R-Type Delta.Stage X4.0 - Warship Out Of Hell - Based on the 3rd stage from R-Type.Set 3Released on July 9, 2021.Stage X5.0 - Distorted Ecosystem - Based on the 2nd stage from R-Type Final.Stage X6.0 - Resource Quarry Ruins - Based on the 4th stage from R-Type II.Stage X7.0 - Encounter - Based on the 1st stage from R-Type.Stage Pass Volume TwoSet 4Released on October 15, 2021.Stage Y1.0 - Azure Grotto - Based on the the 2nd stage from R-Type II.Stage Y2.0 - Materialized Virtual Training Space - Based on the 3rd stage from Image Fight.Set 5Released on January 28, 2022.Stage Y3.0 - Geirrod Fortress Strategic War - Based on the Geirrod Fortress in R-Type Tactics II.Stage Y4.0 - Corrosion - Based on the 4th stage from R-Type Delta.Set 6Released on February 24, 2022.Stage Y5.0 - Forgotten Lab - Based on the 4th stage from R-Type Final.Stage Y6.0 - Pluto Outer Base Glitnir Strategic War - Based on the Glitnir Fortress in R-Type Tactics II.Stage Y7.0 - Bio-Cavity - Based on the 2nd stage from R-Type.Stage Pass Volume ThreeSet 7Released on August 10, 2022.Stage Z1.0 - On a Shining Green Planet - Based on the the 1st stage from Battle Chopper.Stage Z2.0 - Deep Sea Ruins - Based on the 5th stage from In The Hunt.Set 8Released on September 25, 2022.Stage Z3.0 - The City That Sleeps - Based on the 1st stage from R-Type Final.Stage Z4.0 - Auxiliary Base - Based on the 5th stage from R-Type II.Set 9Released on October 29, 2022.Stage Z5.0 - Front Line Base - Based on the 4th stage from R-Type.Stage Z6.0 - Awakening - Based on the 6th stage from R-Type Delta.

The game's development has been off and on over more than a decade, and is currently suspended with the intent to be resumed at some point in the future.Development HistoryFirst announced in late 90's while ADOM was still under active development, JADE (Java-based Ancient Domains Engine) was slated to be ADOM's successor. Unlike ADOM which was written primarily in C++, JADE would use Java, allowing for more features, greater complexity, more content, and broader scope due to the efficiency and power that development in Java would enable. As ADOM development wound down, JADE development progressed sporadically in fits and starts until it eventually dragged to a near halt in the early 2000's. No playable versions of the game were released.In 2011, Thomas returned to JADE development with renewed vigor and determination, and just in time for his birthday in July, he managed to release the first barebones playable version of the game in version 0.1.0. At the start of 2012, Thomas decided to rename JADE to ADOM II, relegating the JADE name to referring strictly to the underlying engine powering the game. Thomas has said that he is working hard to maintain a ""release early, release often"" philosophy in making ADOM II, which is intended to result in major new releases every couple of months.Throughout ADOM II's (and JADE's) long development, Thomas has openly discussed the game's development on his blog with the ADOM fan community. Although Thomas has always retained ultimate creative control over the design development of the game, community input has informed many facets of the game, including technical features, audio/visual presentation, game balance/design, quest fiction, and more. Fan contributions will even provide the game's logo design and all of its music.In late 2012, development on ADOM II was indefinitely suspended after Thomas decided to give the original ADOM one last chance for revived development with a crowdfunding campaign. The campaign was successful and Thomas hired a couple of community members to become co-developers on the project to modernize and expand ADOM.As of early 2015, JADE development remains in limbo while ADOM is finally close to being released on Steam.",,,,,,,,,

1441770,Moonlight In Garland,,,,0,0,0,,,,,"OverviewPersona 3: Dancing in Moonlight, also known as Persona 3: Dancing Moon Night in Japan, is a rhythm game for the PlayStation 4 and the PlayStation Vita. The PS4 version of the game is also compatible with PlayStation VR in a limited manner.Developed by Atlus' P Studio, and simultaneously released alongside Persona 5: Dancing in Starlight, it is a spiritual successor to 2015's Persona 4: Dancing All Night. The game features the characters and music of Persona 3, with all-new songs, and remixes as well.StoryElizabeth finally got permission to renovate the Velvet Room. (She didn't.)For a slight change of pace, the Tartarus-touring team's sub-consciousnesses have been invited by Elizabeth to ""a subterranean garden of uninhibited spectacle, where dancers are dictated by the sway of one's inner passions,"" also known as Club Velvet.Not to be outdone by her older or younger sisters, Elizabeth, or Eli-P (short for Producer) has decided to hold a dance party as a means of determining who, out of the Velvet Room siblings, has the best guests of them all. Thinking it could be fun, and seeing how dancing between dream and reality, mind and matter, has the added benefit of making them able to pull off professional-level moves without dedicating years of practice to the art form, the members of S.E.E.S. agree to help her out.Game ModesThere are two different game modes available in Persona 3: Dancing in MoonlightDancing!The ""Dancing!"" mode is the equivalent of the ""Free Dance"" mode from Persona 4: Dancing All Night. This is where the player can choose which song they would like to play, and on which difficulty.Each song has a dancer assigned to it, and they cannot be changed. However, once the player has completed a song, they will get to choose which, if any, additional dancers will support the main one during the song's ""Fever Time"" sections. Additional partners can be unlocked for songs by clearing the song in question on the game's different difficulty options. Each pairing of dancers has unique choreography, and dialogue between them.In addendum, if the song is long enough, and features two Fever Time sections, the player can pick a different character for each, or if they so choose, the same one twice. This is a new feature in P3D, since previously in P4D, the latter was the only option. Once a song has been chosen, the player can then customize their dancer or dancers' appearance as they please.At first, only 4 out of the 25 playable songs are available, but more can be unlocked by simply completing songs on the difficulty of the player's choosing, or by fulfilling various assignments, described inside the brand-new ""Social"" mode.SocialAigis is quick to pick up on the world-famous Velvet Room Song.Replacing the traditional Story Mode from P4D is the Social mode (also known as the Commu mode in Japan). This is where the player can engage in fully voice-acted Social Link-like events with the members of the Special Extracurricular Execution Squad, and the ""Lethal Elevator Attendant,"" Elizabeth.Starting out, each character has 5 Social scenes that can be viewed after they have been unlocked. These scenes can be accessed by completing various tasks. The tasks are different for each character, and they include everything from hitting notes well enough and for enough times, to simply outfitting the dancers with all sorts of costumes and gear for their dance routines. The requirements for their completion can be seen on each characters' respective pages.As an example, to unlock Aigis' first Social scene, the player must hit a total of 1000 notes with the ""PERFECT"" rating during gameplay, and to unlock the second tier, they must reach a total of 3000, and so on and so forth.Once the player has seen all 5 Social scenes for a character, 3 more scenes will become available for unlocking, bringing the total amount of event scenes for each character to 8.During a character's sixth scene, the player character will be invited to their friend's room in the Iwatodai Dorm. After the scene is over, they will then get the ability to roam around the room, from a first-person perspective, and with some very basic controls like walking and crouching. Some of the Persona-users' rooms could be seen and even visited in Persona 3 and its re-releases, but this is the first time the player has the ability to look around them freely.This is also where the PlayStation VR headset can be used to look around the room in more detail, but the rooms are fully explorable without one, as well.Unlocking Challenge Modifiers (by fulfilling gameplay-related tasks) also contributes toward unlocking Mitsuru's Social scenes.Whatever items the room's owner has laying around can be inspected, and the player character will comment on what it is that they're seeing, whether it's a poster of a boy band in Yukari's room, or a crate filled with belts of gatling gun ammunition in Aigis'. Each time the player visits, the rooms will be in a different state of order, or disorder (especially in Junpei's case), and so for each visit there's always a little something new to find and poke at.Furthermore, Eli-P has prepared a treasure hunt for each of the remaining 3 Social scenes, her's being the exception. Once an event that takes place in someone's room is over, the player must do some searching around to find Prize Cards, left behind by Elizabeth. Once the player finds a card (each usually hidden better than the last), they're rewarded with various costumes, or accessories as prizes. The cards are accompanied by a sound effect, which makes finding them a little easier.All Social scenes can be replayed from the menu, once seen. This includes the scenes 6 through 8, after which the S.E.E.S. members' rooms can be explored. This can be useful, in case the player simply cannot find a hidden prize card during their initial visit, and would like to return to it later, for example.GameplayThe core rhythm gameplay in P3D is near-identical to that of its predecessor, Persona 4: Dancing All Night, with a few new twists.The goal is to hit the notes that appear as accurately as possible, and to the rhythm of the song thatâs being played. When the player hits 5 notes well enough in a row, a combo will begin, which the player will then want to keep up for as long as they can to get the highest score and performance rating possible.Notes fly from the center of the screen to its edges, where there are six icons waiting for the corresponding buttons. The default buttons are: the up, left, and down arrows on the left side of the screen, and the triangle, circle, and X buttons on the right. In the PlayStation Vita version of the game these standard, star or letter-adorned notes can also be hit by touching them on the Vitaâs touchscreen. Both sets of icons are also connected by a line, which acts as the optimal hitting point for the âRings,â which are explained later, below.NotesThe standard notes come in four different flavors:Clearing the Double Notes is not especially challenging, but they at least provide clarity, and make the charts easier to read when the going gets tough.The basic, blue and starry-eyed notes can be cleared with a single button press when the note overlaps with the corresponding icon on the screen. Green âHold Notesâ require the player to hold down a button for an amount of time, and then let go, both to the beat of the music. The purple âUnison Notesâ have the player hitting two different buttons simultaneously, with one on each side of the screen.Finally, âDouble Notesâ make their debut in P3D. Appearance-wise these notes are two connected, blue notes with capital D letters in the middle of them. These notes always appear one after another, which means that to clear it, the player must hit the same button two times in a row. If the player misses the first section of the note, the second one becomes greyed out and cannot be pressed. While the Double Note consists of two notes, not hitting them still results in a single âMissâ in the final scoring.RingsThe Ring notes mentioned above have two different variations. The normal ones are called âScratches,â and they are blue in color. Their funkier brethren are called âFever Ringsâ and they are multi-colored in style. Both types of rings are also plastered in their respective names.Familiar locations, such as the Port Island Station, serve as the crew's dance stages, each song sporting one unique to them.The Ring notes are a bit more peculiar than the standard notes, in that they can be ignored, if the player so wishes, and their combo will not be interrupted and broken. If the player does hit one, however, they are awarded with another addition to their combo. So, if the player is chasing a high score, and not simply looking to clear the song, they will want to hit these notes, also. The Fever Rings are otherwise identical to the blue ones, but they also award the player a single stock of âFever Meterâ.The Rings can be cleared in several ways, once they reach their goal, which is to say when they overlap with the icons on the sides of the screen. Using a DualShock 4, the player can hit these by flicking either of the analog sticks in any direction, or by Scratching the touchpad. If the player is on a Vita, all of these controls also apply there, but instead of the touchpad (which the Vita does not have), the front and rear touchscreens can be used.Lastly, under the options menu, there is an option to enable the L1 and R1 shoulder buttons as a means of clearing them, which has the added benefit of freeing up the playerâs thumbs to solely focus on the standard notes (Up, Left, Down, Triangle, Circle, and X).Fever TimeOnce the player has gathered three stocks of Fever Meter, by clearing at least three Fever Rings, and they reach a specific part of a song (usually the chorus, or a drop), they have the chance to enter what is referred to by the game as âFever Timeâ.This version of the Iwatodai Dorm clearly takes inspiration from Levelord's work.During Fever Time, the player is rewarded with additional visual flares, and a gameplay advantage. The dance stages and backgrounds light up in colorful lights, an audience can be heard cheering, and even the borders of the screen start flashing to signify a job well done. The main dancer is also joined on-stage by a supporting dancer, if the player has chosen one, and the characters will then dance together for a short while. Still, there is a small performance-related caveat to this, which is explained under the âHype Gaugeâ section.On the mechanical, gameplay side of things, the player gets a benefit: Normally, hitting a note slightly off-beat results in a âGoodâ rating for that one specific note, and the playerâs combo is also broken, but during Fever Time these slight mistakes wonât be accounted for, and the streak will continue as if nothing had happened at all.Hype GaugeThis Shadow-adorned meter, which symbolizes the feelings of the audience, is located in the top-left corner of the screen and gives an easy-to-read way of telling how well the player is currently doing on a song.The meter has five possible colors. From lowest to highest they are as follows: red, yellow, white, green, and once the meter hits its peak, it will start flashing with the colors of the rainbow.Once a song starts, the gauge will already be filled to its half-way point, and its contents will then increase or decrease, based on if the player is hitting the notes successfully, or not. If the player misses enough notes, the screen will start to dim, and once the meter empties out completely, itâs game over for the player, and they will be given the âNot Clearâ rating.Finally, its condition also dictates what will happen, should the player enter Fever Time. Any supporting dancers will not join the main one on-stage if the Hype Gauge is not at least green at the start of the Fever Time section (indicated on the timeline, at the bottom of the screen). Otherwise, the main dancer will have to continue to hold it down, alone.DifficultyThe four difficulty levels from Persona 4: Dancing All Night make their return: Easy, Normal, Hard, and All Night. All difficulties have their own unique rhythm chart patterns, and the higher the setting, the more complex they get. With high risk comes high reward, and so not only does the setting determine how many points are doled out, it also changes how many notes can be missed before the player fails a song.This time around unlocking the final, most brutal difficulty, âAll Night,â is a little more straightforward.In P4D the player had to purchase every single item from the shop using in-game currency, which was earned by playing songs. Here, since P3D and P5D have done away with the shop and the currency, all thatâs required of the player is to clear all 25 of the songs featured in the base game once.ScoringWhen it comes to scoring in P3D, there are several kinds.The player can hit a standard music note in three different ways. âPerfectâ means they have been right on the money, âGreatâ follows a near-perfect hit, and âGoodâ is more like a participation award. The last one also causes the playerâs theoretical combo to break, but it will happen if they completely âMissâ the note, too.The timeline on the results screen is useful for showing off where in the song the player might have made mistakes.âNot Clear,â âStage Clear,â âBrilliant,â and âKing Crazyâ are the four different performance ratings the player can receive after reaching the end of a song. The first one usually follows when the player misses too many notes, and empties out their Hype Gauge, but it can also appear if they have barely hung on through to the end of the song, hitting a bunch of notes with only a Good rating along the way.Stage Clear and Brilliant are awarded when the player has successfully cleared a song. Which one they get depends on the number of notes hit, and the way in which they were hit.King Crazy is the highest possible rating. In addition to hitting all the standard notes with at least ""Great"" timing, the player must also have Scratched all the Rings to reach this rating. Any songs that have been cleared this well will get a small crown stamp that's displayed next to the song title in the menu after the fact.After the player has played for a while they might notice that these four ratings are all thatâs surfaced while theyâre picking out songs in the Dancing! menu. It should also be mentioned that the game also keeps track of a numeric point total, however. During gameplay, the score can be seen in the top-right corner of the HUD, and itâs also shown off during the results screen. To look at these scores after the fact, the player must dig deep into the Collection section of the main menu. Here, there is also an online leaderboard where scores can be compared.Since only the top 20 high scores in the world can be seen at a time, to even have a chance of competing online the player must be willing to up the ante by the way of adding âModifiersâ to their gameplay.ModifiersAlongside the different difficulty levels, the player can also choose to modify their gameplay experience to their liking by enabling modifiers before starting a song, of which there are two kinds: The ones that help the player but also negatively impact their score, and ones that make songs even harder but give them a percentage of an increase to their final score.Examples of Support modifiers:Automatically clear Scratches (-9%)Missing a note doesnât impact the Hype Gauge as much (-12%)Hitting a note with a Good rating doesnât break a combo (-15% to final score)Examples of Challenge modifiers:Not hitting a Scratch results in a Miss (+4%)The speed at which notes approach wavers (+8%)Notes are hidden (+40% to final score)Outfits & AccessoriesSince Tanakaâs Amazing Commodities doesnât quite reach into the Velvet Room, undoubtedly much to the Presidentâs chagrin, the player no longer has to use in-game currency to unlock different outfits. Instead, they are tied to the their progression in the Social menu.Hanging out with Elizabeth and the members of S.E.E.S. awards the player with numerous different costumes and accessories. Most of these items are call-backs, and thus familiar to fans of the series, but like the dance outfits featured on the box art of the game, there are some brand new items as well.""Only with strength can one endure suffering and torment.""Some of the costumes included are the seasonal variants of the crewâs outfits, Halloween and Christmas costumes, swimsuits, and Velvet Room attendant and S.E.E.S. uniforms.Accessories include everything from fake mustaches to 70âs sunglasses, and sets of Pixie wings to illustrated sound effects.Because thereâs been an increase in the number of item slots for each character, the player has more freedom to mix and match these items as they wish. Persona 4: Dancing All Night featured only three slots, one for a main outfit, and two additional accessory slots. P3D and P5D bring that number to six total slots: body, head, two accessory slots, eye color, and hair color.Additionally, there are more outfits available on the PlayStation Store as downloadable content. As an example, one pack includes outfits from characters in the Shin Megami Tensei series of games, and another one has collaboration items from the Virtua Fighter (P3D), and Yakuza (P5D) series.Another new feature in P3D is the ability to save loadouts. Up to eight different sets of outfits and accessories can be saved at a time, per character.DancersThe game has a total of 16 dancers, six of which are downloadable. Each character has their own dancing style that is unique to them: The endearingly eccentric Elizabeth's dramatic Waacking perfectly encapsulates her personality, whereas the always-serious captain of the Gekkoukan High School boxing team, Akihiko, in not wanting to let any precious training time go to waste (even inside a dream), can clearly be seen incorporating some shadowboxing into his routine.Persona 3: Dancing in Moonlight's cast of playable characters includes most of the Special Extracurricular Execution Squad, and their partners in time:Makoto YukiYukari TakebaMitsuru KirijoAkihiko SanadaJunpei IoriFuuka YamagishiAigisKen AmadaElizabethMargaret (Only available as a supporting dancer during Elizabeth's dance routine.)Additionally, more dancers will be purchasable as downloadable content, after the game has been released:Shinjiro AragakiTheodoreGoro AkechiLavenza (Persona 5 end-game spoilers)Sho MinazukiLabrys (In addition to having her own song, she is also available as a supporting dancer during Elizabeth's dance routine in the standard version of the game, free of charge.)Track ListEven the notorious wallflower Makoto has decided to join the fray.Series' main composer Shoji Meguro, and the many music producers of Atlus have once again come together with a number of guest composers from Japan's game, and music industries to collaborate on the soundtrack of Persona 3: Dancing in Moonlight.Yuyoyuppe, a composer whose work with Vocaloid software got him noticed by the masses, has remixed the emotional, Yumi Kawamura-sung ""Brand New Days"" into a double-pedaled headbanger of a heavy metal version. Meanwhile, sasakure.UK has turned one of the hip-hop, and rock-influenced battle themes of Persona Q: Shadow of the Labyrinth into a more upbeat, and electronic version of its former self.Also involved is a big self-proclaimed fan of the series, Hideki Naganuma, who brings his electronic expertise from the Jet Set Radio games to Tatsumi Port Island.The song list of Persona 3: Dancing in Moonlight features 25 playable songs, and an additional 30 have been confirmed as downloadable content post-launch, bringing the total number of playable songs available for the game to 55.An overview of the downloadable songs' release schedule and pricing is located below the track list of songs included on the standard version of the game, but further details can be found on the games' official websites, and on the PlayStation Store.Song TitleDancerFirst AppearanceAria of the Soul (t.komine Remix)ElizabethAT1st ~Persona3 & Persona4~ Club Arrange (originally Persona 3)^The Battle for Everyone's Souls (Daisuke Asakura Remix)Group Performance:Akihiko, Junpei, Ken, and MakotoPersona 3: Dancing in Moonlight (originally Persona 3)Brand New DaysMusic video*Persona 3 FESBrand New Days (Yuyoyuppe Remix)MakotoPersona 3: Dancing in MoonlightBurn My DreadEveryone (-Elizabeth)Persona 3Burn My Dread -Last Battle-Music videoPersona 3Burn My Dread (Novoiski Remix)MitsuruAT1st ~Persona3 & Persona4~ Club ArrangeDeep Breath Deep Breath (Yuu Miyake Remix)JunpeiPersona 3: Dancing in Moonlight (originally Persona 3)Deep Mentality (Lotus Juice Remix)JunpeiPersona 3: Dancing in Moonlight (originally Persona 3)Heartful Cry (ATLUS Konishi Remix)AigisPersona 3: Dancing in Moonlight (originally Persona 3 FES)Laser Beam (PERSONA SUPER LIVE P-SOUND BOMB !!!! 2017)Music videoPersona Q: Shadow of the LabyrinthLight the Fire Up in the Night ""KAGEJIKAN"" + ""MAYONAKA""AkihikoPersona Q: Shadow of the LabyrinthLight the Fire Up in the Night ""KAGEJIKAN"" + ""MAYONAKA"" (sasakure.UK Remix)KenPersona 3: Dancing in MoonlightMass Destruction (""P3"" + ""P3F"" ver.)MakotoPersona 3: Dancing in Moonlight (originally Persona 3)Mass Destruction (Tetsuya Kobayashi Remix)KenPersona 3: Dancing in MoonlightMemories of You (ATLUS Meguro Remix)Group Performance:Aigis, Fuuka, Yukari, and MitsuruPersona 3: Dancing in Moonlight (originally Persona 3)Moonlight SerendipityMusic videoPersona 3: Dancing in MoonlightOur Moment (Opening version)Music videoPersona 3: Dancing in MoonlightSoul PhraseAkihikoPersona 3 PortableTime (ATLUS Kitajoh Remix)FuukaPersona 3: Dancing in Moonlight (originally Persona 3 Portable)Want To Be Close (ATOLS Remix)YukariPersona 3: Dancing in Moonlight (originally Persona 3)A Way of Life (ATLUS Kitajoh Remix)AigisPersona 3: Dancing in Moonlight (originally Persona 3 Portable)When the Moon's Reaching Out StarsMitsuruPersona 3When the Moon's Reaching Out Stars (Hideki Naganuma Remix)YukariPersona 3: Dancing in MoonlightWiping All Out (ATLUS Kozuka remix)FuukaPersona 3: Dancing in Moonlight (originally Persona 3 Portable)^""AT1st ~Persona3 & Persona4~ Club Arrange"" is an official remix album that was released in 2013. As the name implies, it features nine new arrangements for songs from Personas 3 and 4. Its release coincided with the Persona Music FES 2013, a live music festival that took place in the Nippon Budokan stadium, in Chiyoda, Tokyo.*This song does not have a dancer assigned to it. Instead, a playable, but non-interactive music video plays in the background.Downloadable SongsAtlus has planned to release a total of 30 new songs as downloadable content, after the games' release. These songs include the downloadable dancers listed above, as well as playable music videos. The core gameplay remains the same between the two, although the music videos naturally have none of the character customization available to them.All downloadable dancers and playable music videos are supported by both, and all versions of Persona 3: Dancing in Moonlight, and Persona 5: Dancing in Starlight.This means that even if the player owns both games, one on the Vita, and one on the PS4, and buys Shinjiro for example, they can play as him in either game and on either platform, without having to make separate purchases for each game.The release schedule for the Japanese versions of the games can be seen below.Launch day/May:Song TitlePriceFormatDescriptionDance!FreeMV*Theme song of Persona 4: Dancing All Night.GROOVYFreeMVFull version of the theme song of Persona 5: Dancing in Starlight.More Than One HeartÂ¥350MVTheme song of the first Persona 3 movie, ""Spring of Birth"" that features scenes from the movie as the visuals.Our MomentFreeMVFull version of the theme song of Persona 3: Dancing in Moonlight.Voice feat.

1441790,Miner: Dig Deep,699,Substance Games,Substance Games,0,0,3,"Adventure, Casual, Indie, Simulation","English, Traditional Chinese, Czech",,,"OverviewUpgrades and new items can be purchased aboveground.Miner Dig Deep is an Xbox Live Indie Game released on February 4, 2009, and developed and published by Robir. Miner Dig Deep costs 80 Microsoft Points, or $1.00. The premise of the game is essentially explained in the title; the goal of the game is to literally dig deeper. This can be accomplished with the usage of a variety of items, uncovering minerals, rocks, and other materials. The game only ends after every single upgrade is purchased.Developed by a team of three people ( James Ribaux, Brendan Ribaux, and Will Ribaux), an interview with James Ribaux revealed some information about the game's development. Initially conceived by Brendan Ribaux, the Robir team only consisted of two people until the game reached the end of its development, when the brothers brought Will Ribaux on board. Overall development time was approximately three months.GameplayAs lantern oil wanes, the player's line of sight is lowered.Miner Dig Deep is literally a game about digging deeper, collecting resources, and upgrading equipment. Collecting resources is done by digging into a certain area (with the pickaxe tool, available from the start), and then mining the resource by hitting it repeatedly. Resources vary in rarity and price, with early metals only worth $75 and later minerals worth over $1000. Along with resources are rocks strewn throughout the subterranean world. Rocks are triggered by digging beneath them, causing them to begin sinking into the earth, possibly killing the miner if the player is not quick enough.Lantern oil is an important aspect of Miner Dig Deep's gameplay. As the player explores the underground world, the lantern reveals what is hidden in the earth surrounding the player. When the player is completely out of lantern oil, they can continue to explore, but are unable to see anything without actually hitting it. Lantern oil capacity, overall inventory capacity, and the pickaxe can all be upgraded for set amounts periodically.Mines can be traversed quickly by using teleportation panels and elevators.Along with lantern oil and inventory capacity, there are a variety of other purchasable items in the overworld store. Ladders, elevators, and teleportation panels all help to speed up the exploration of the underground world. Ladders are the cheapest, and can be used to place a single climbable object underground. Elevators are sold in varying degrees, and can be used to quickly go up and down underground. Teleportation panels are meant for when the player gets truly deep underground (such as 1000 meters or deeper). They warp the player right back to the surface.Both the overworld and the underground world are randomly generated with each play session. The grass and trees on the surface are changed each time the game is played, while underground the resources available are renewed after every play session. However, extensive exploration of the underground world can cause one particular event: earthquakes. Earthquakes are triggered when the pathways that the player has dug are far too unstable, causing cave-ins and tunnel collapses which adds a new level of danger for climbing the way out, effectively adding difficulty the further underground the player goes.",,,,,,,,,

It was funded via Kickstarter and released on Steam on May 30th, 2014.The game is episodic, with the second and third episodes coming some time in the future. GameplayThe player controls A.R.I.D., a combat suit AI, in a side-scrolling action/adventure game.A.R.I.D. can use a flashlight to highlight certain objects in the environment, some of which she can interact with. The game utilizes an inventory system, which has to be used to solve many of the game's puzzles. The puzzles consist mainly of item combinations, environmentally specific actions and dialog trees.Aside from the puzzles, there are also some action elements mixed into the gameplay. A.R.I.D. can shoot a gun to fend off enemy security droids, while either taking cover behind objects in the environment or using the camouflage function built into her suit.StoryThe Fall is about A.R.I.D., a female, artificial intelligence system that has been integrated into an armored combat suit. The combat suit A.I. becomes activated, and autonomous, when the human inside it is rendered unconscious after falling from an undisclosed location into a derelict underground facility.A.R.I.D. awakes in a half-initialized state, with very little control over the suit and its functions. She has to find a way to override some of her main functions if she wants to prevent the human from dying, but has trouble doing so because of her programming.On her journey to save the human, she encounters a friendly mainframe A.I. with a quirky personality, who is trying to help her. Meanwhile, another A.I, the ""Caretaker"", tries to stop A.R.I.D. The Caretaker interrogates A.R.I.D., finding her programming faulty. Through the rest of the game, the Caretaker stalks A.R.I.D. and tries to shut her down for de-purposing.",,,,,,,,,

1441620,Illness in the East Demo,0,Bogozet,Bogozet,0,0,1,,Russian,,,"A turn based strategy game that allows players to fight either a large campaign or smaller specialized scenarios. The starting years for the campaigns are 1941, 1942, 1943 and 1944. There are 10 different scenarios that last anywhere from 10 to 25 turns. An interesting feature is that new units must be trained behind the front line before they are sent to the front, adding another dimension to the game's strategy. There are around 4000 units in the game and the player can create various unique units as well. There are also 500 historically accurate military commanders for the player to assign to various units. Unit commanders can be killed in action, and the player can dismiss, fire, or execute commanders at will. The attributes of military commanders are divided between military and political prowess.A major point of appeal for War in the East is the accurate representation of the Soviet industrial migration that occurred during the first year of the Great Patriotic War. The Soviet player suffers from heavy production penalties and delays representing the reconstitution of factories east of the Urals. The player must keep track of various spreadsheets outlining unit ammunition, battle fatigue, and strength. Although units are presented at the division level the various brigades that comprise a division are susceptible to varying degrees of damage, meaning that the player must allocate supplies and reinforcements to the most worn-out units.System RequirementsOS: Windows XP/Vista/7CPU: 1.5GHz+RAM: 1GBVideo Card: 128MB DirectX 9+ CompatibleSound Card: 16 bit DirectX 9+ CompatibleHard Drive Space: 1.5 GB FreeDirectX 9.0c",,,,,,,,,

On-screen indicators align with enemies and incoming magical projectiles which must first be dealt with through a series of on-rails corridors before confronting a boss character.GameplayEach âstageâ in the game is broken into two parts referred to as Tracks. Track 1 is where you tap and swipe your way through âlesser demonsâ and Track 2 presents a âcinematic rhythm battle against the great demons of the abyssâ.Playing similarly to iNiS' Ouendan series, the circular on-screen indicators must be tapped in time with the music as a dial fills around their perimeter. Some indicators must be tapped and swiped in an indicated direction and others must be held down and swiped to follow a specific path. Some segments require an indicator to be pressed repeatedly as quickly as possible.A health bar, score display and combo meter encourage players to hit all the indicators as accurately as possible and are graded on a four-point scale from Miss, to Hit, Smash, up to Critical. Experience points are gained based on number of hits and maximum combo which feed into a leveling system and unlock supplementary items can be selected at the end of each stage.Completing each stage on Easy, Normal, and Hard difficulties will also lead to more unlockable content. Most of the ten stages revolve around a specific demon and feature unique enemies or backgrounds but can be played while Serenity is possessed by any other demon. Her abilities, costume, voice and personality change accordingly encouraging even more repeat plays to see and hear everything the game has to offer. The first stageâs music will also change based on which demon she is possessed by.StoryIn Salem, Massachusetts, âaverage college girlâ Serenity mysteriously loses contact with her father Dr. Aliester. She sets out to find him at the Salem State Hospital & Asylum where he works and is soon confronted by a talking teddy bear named David who claims to have once been human. Suddenly surrounded by demons, Serenity finds that she can take control of any demon who possesses her body thanks to the Demonsâ Score app that her father had recently sent to her smartphone. Fighting her way through the twisted worlds that each demon drags her into, she searches for her father and an explanation to these bizarre events.MusicThe hit songwriters, later detailed as âthe music world of Japanâs leading musiciansâ who have contribued music to the game include: Yoko Shimomura (Kingdom Hearts), Kohei Tanaka (Sakura Wars), Naoshi Mizuta (Final Fantasy XI), Ryo Yamazaki (Crystal Chronicles), Keiichi Okabe (NiER), Hirokazu Koshio and Shohei Tsuchiya (Zuntata), Hiroki Kikuta (Secret of Mana), Takamichi Yashiki (iNiS/The Black Eyed Peas Experience), Kenji Ito (SaGA series), Hidenori Iwasaki (Front Mission 4 & 5), and Kenichi Maeyamada (Momokurotei Ichimon).",,,,,,,,,
1440440,Sam & Max Save the World,1999,Skunkape Games,Skunkape Games,599,690,7,"Adventure, Indie","English, French, Italian, German, Spanish - Spain, Czech, Hungarian, Polish, Russian",,,"OverviewReleased beginning in 2006 under an episodic release schedule, Sam & Max Save the World is the first Sam & Max release since Hit the Road, as well as one of Telltale Games' first major releases. Sam & Max Save the World consists of six episodes:Episode 1: Culture Shock Episode 2: Situation: ComedyEpisode 3: The Mole, the Mob, and the MeatballEpisode 4: Abe Lincoln Must Die!Episode 5: Reality 2.0Episode 6: Bright Side of the MoonDistributionSam and Max Season One was initially distributed through GameTap, a subscription based PC gaming service, and followed by a worldwide release through Telltale Games' own website 15 days later. The series also saw a full release on  Valve's Steam distribution service. A Wii version of the game was announced on April 4th 2008, and is a port of its PC counterpart, albeit with integrated motion controls. On February 26th 2009, Telltale announced the game would be released on XBLA with the new name of 'Sam & Max: Save the World' (rather than ""Sam & Max Season One""), which released on June 17 of the same year.Episode 4, ""Abe Lincoln Must Die!"", was made released for free through both  Steam and  Telltale's website, to promote the season. Following Telltale's closure, the game can no longer be downloaded from their website. As well, the episode's original store page is no longer accessible, however the episode can still be installed using Steam's install command.On December 2, 2020, a remaster of Sam & Max Save the World was released on Steam, GOG, and Nintendo Switch. The remaster was created by Skunkape Games, a team comprised of former Telltale developers who had acquired the rights to Sam & Max as well as source materials from the game's original release. As well as remastering the game's visuals, the new release features reworked dialogue, alongside consulting from Sam & Max cartoonist Steve Purcell to guide the game's visuals and humor. Following the release of the game's remaster, the original Sam & Max Save the World was de-listed from Steam, however the original version of Save the World was reintroduced as free DLC for the remaster.GameplayThe primary gameplay in Sam and Max consists of leisurely walking around the Freelance Police officers' office and its city surroundings, such as a continuously career changing lady friend's office, Bosco's Inconvenience Store and various other locations, depending on the episode. Players are tasked with solving puzzles and answering riddles to advance the game's story, which shoots for the comical stars. Bosco's in Reality 2.0.Pointing and clicking on an area allows the player to move Sam (Max follows without getting in the way), while ""clicking/button pressing"" examines specific objects, and adds them to your inventory as necessary. Items are often needed for later puzzles, so combining certain collected goods and inserting, dropping, or applying them to things will usually solve a good chunk of the game's puzzles. From Sam's revolver to a slice of cheese, the variety of collectibles is ridiculously varied.There is also a driving component of the game, where the player controls the gas and side-to-side motion of Sam's police cruiser, while simultaneously integrating a combat mechanic using Sam's revolver. Shooting out baddies tires completes certain objectives, and also garners some angry remarks from civilian traffic. Innocents can be pulled over for speeding (or a busted tail light, should you decide to shoot it out) if players bore of driving aimlessly.The dialogue system heavily influences the story, though in a linear fashion. Sam and Max will need to be quick on the tongue with witty dialogue to get the info they need, or out of a dilemma. Many puzzles center around this conversation mechanic, such as talking down crazed enemies, and immense trickery!",,,,,,,,,

1440680,SIDE,1499,Tly,Tly,0,0,0,"Action, Adventure, Indie",English,,,"OverviewPlanetSide 2 is a massively multiplayer first-person shooter that focuses on massive scale combat with battles taking place between thousands of players. Players have access to air and ground vehicles and wage war in open fields, tightly packed urban centres, and enormous structures.Player progression and customization are major features of the game, and players are able to unlock combat roles by advancing through skill trees, including several classic roles from PlanetSide. Players are able to switch back and forth between roles they have unlocked using a new class system, replacing the old, open-ended inventory system for a more modern and streamlined kit outfitted along the lines of the chosen class, much like in Battlefield 3.GameplayFactionsTerran RepublicThe Terran Republic is an authoritarian government that uses its military might to maintain strict control over the colonial citizens. They are obsessed with the preservation of law and order and are therefore seen by some to be an oppressive force. However, many view the Republic as the only hope for lasting security on Auraxis.New ConglomerateThe New Conglomerate operates as a band of dissidents that are opposed to the power that the Terran Republic has on Auraxis. Led by an unusual group of outcasts, industry titans, pirates and former military leaders, the New Conglomerate has found itself with significant power of its own, and is prepared to achieve their goals by any means necessary.Vanu SovereigntyVanu has taught that only through advanced technology can humanity evolve to its next state of existence. The Vanu Sovereignty is extremely advanced, frequently using powerful alien technology on the battlefield. Their sole purpose is to uncover the secrets hidden away in ancient artifacts scattered over the surface of Auraxis, and they will destroy any group that interferes or threatens the world they seek to study.ClassesInfiltratorA unit with nearly no armor to protect it, relying instead on cloaking technology and sniper rifles to assist it in reconnaissance and sabotage actions.Light AssaultA lightly-armored unit with jump jets and a lightweight rifle for quick movement and vertical agility on the battlefield. This unit also carries deployable ammo packs, in order to provide the ammunition required for whole squads to sustain longer engagements with the enemy.MedicA unit with a tool to heal others around them, and able to take the fight to the enemy with light rifles and armor, akin to the Light Assault class. Medics keep others alive and revive fallen players, aiding in keeping the men and women around them in good condition, no matter the odds stacked against them.EngineerA unit with light armor and basic weapons for infantry assault, these units specialize in field repairs of vehicle and MAX armor, as well as being able to deploy various offensive and defensive force augmenters such as mines and stationary manned turret emplacements.Heavy AssaultA unit with most man-sized weapons available to them, these soldiers not only have the heaviest armor of normal infantry, but also can use the hardest-hitting weaponry, including infantry-based anti-tank weaponry. To increase the survivability in a sustained fight, the Heavy Assault can activate a shield that will absorb damage for a short time.MAXA large exo-suit unit with massive armor and two arm-mounted heavy weapons, the MAX units act as the anchor for any infantry assault, against enemy infantry, armor, or air. These units are built like man-sized walking tanks and are the dealers of death, though their lack of agility can leave them extremely exposed if not supported by friendly forces.ContinentsAmerishJungle and wetlands rule this place, with colored crystallites scattered around and broken open to the uncaring world of the ongoing war around them. Heavily forested zones make for a lot of cover from air vehicles and difficult for larger, more cumbersome land vehicles to navigate easily.EsamirA land forever entombed in a harsh winter, this cold land is home to mountainous and rocky terrain covered in a white glaze of fresh snowfall. A desolate place from the biting cold, there is little in the way of flora to hide among or behind, and as such will likely be dominated by aircraft.IndarA desert continent, this map is home to a lush plateau in the north leading down into severe and crevassed terrain, as well as large desert plains. The main open spaces makes this map a prime place for vehicular assaults and transport.Vehicles and WeaponsWeapon and vehicle pools are broken up into the âcommon poolâ and âempire-specificâ groupings. Common pool weapons and vehicles are available to all who have the skills for them, meaning that they tend to be highly specialized or fairly average because of the fact that every empire can access them. Empire-specific weapons and vehicles, however, are unique to their empire and not available to those of the opposing factions. These tend to take on the characteristics of each empire and add flavor to them unique from each other.For example, the common pool light tank, the Lightning, is something that anyone who has unlocked the skill for light armor can use. It is very nimble and has fire-power approaching the larger tanks, but its light armor prevents it from withstanding too much damage in a fight with anti-tank weaponry or larger main battle tanks. If one were to skill into heavier armor, a player of the New Conglomerate could access the Vanguard, the most heavily armored and most powerful of the MBTs, but also quite slow; a player of the Terran Republic would have the Prowler available to them, equipped with a multi-barrelled turret and overall the quickest of the MBTs, sporting medium armor; a Vanu Sovereignty player would use the Magrider, the most overall manoeuvrable MBT, using anti-gravitic generators to float over land and water, allowing strafing like no other tank could accomplish with treads, as well as a straight-line (meaning no real projectile drop over distance) plasma cannon that is attached directly to the chassis of the tank itself.Business ModelPlanetSide 2 has been developed and launched as a free-to-play (F2P) game, unlike the original which was built as a subscription-based MMO. While the Station Cash store is available in-game, the designers have no intention to provide âpay-to-winâ advantages for real money. In addition to âsidegradedâ weapons and ammunition for certain consumable items, the store contains customization options for guns, soldiers, and vehicles that can be acquired only with Station Cash, Sony Online Entertainmentâs virtual goods currency.BetaStarting in late June/early July 2012, an invitational beta began with priority access given to original PlanetSide veterans and those with a key from the April 2012 edition of PC Gamer.Playstation 4 VersionOn June 5, 2013, Sony announced the Planetside 2 would be coming to the PS4. This along with Warframe and Blacklight Retribution will not require a Playstation Plus subscription and will be available at the PS4's launch.System RequirementsMinimumOS: Windows XP Processor: Intel Core 2 Duo E6850 or higher / AMD Phenom II X2 or higher Memory: 4 GB RAM Graphics: nVidia GeForce 8600 series or higher / AMD or ATI 4850 series or higher DirectXÂ®: 9.0 Hard Drive: 15 GB HD space Sound: DirectX compatible Sound Card Other Requirements: Broadband Internet connectionRecommendedOS: Windows 7 Processor: Intel i5 processor or higher / AMD Phenom II X6 or higher Memory: 6 GB RAM Graphics: nVidia GeForce 540 or higher / AMD HD 6870 or higher DirectXÂ®: 9.0 Hard Drive: 15 GB HD space Sound: DirectX compatible Sound Card Other Requirements: Broadband Internet connection",,,,,,,,,

1440770,Breach Wanderers Demo,0,Baronnerie Games,Baronnerie Games,0,0,1,,,,,"OverviewYou can't hide in there forever.Breach is a class based first-person shooter in a modern day setting. After their game Six Days In Fallujah was cancelled, Atomic Games set about applying the technologies that had been developed for the game and experience with military simulations to develop a new title, with a focus on real-world equipment.In a similar vein to Zombie Studios' Blacklight: Tango Down, Breach is only available via download and its sole focus is on multiplayer, with the maximum player count set for 8 vs. 8.Release DelayWhile originally scheduled for a late summer 2010 release, Breach was delayed because the team ""missed a small window set by Microsoft"". A new release date, January 26th, 2011, was later announcd. Because of the delay, Atomic were able to add a new game mode, called ""Hardcore"".GameplayActive CoverThe game uses a cover mechanic, similar to the one used in the Rainbow Six: Vegas franchise, in which the player can snap to cover with a button press. The view will then switch from first-person to third-person perspective allowing players to see around the obstacle while remaining in cover.From this position players can either blind-fire, lean out for a more accurate shot, or quickly pop-up into first-person perspective and back again.Destructible EnvironmentsI wonder what my friends are playing right now....The destructible environment is the highlighted point of Breach. It's very detailed, similar to Red Faction: Guerilla. When a grenade explodes next to a wall, a section of the wall isn't blown away. Individual bricks and wooden planks are independent of each other and will break away from the wall. If you're a Recon and want to make a small hole to shoot through a wall, you can shoot away just one brick to maximize the amount of cover.MapsBreach has a selection of five maps on which to play the game's various modes.The PassageSiloPeakAscentNocturnal - Essentially an nighttime version of The Passage map.Game ModesBreach can be played in one of five different game typesInfiltration - Domination-style play in which teammates must work together to hold a series of points across the map. The longer a point is held, the more points are awarded.Convoy - One team must escort a convoy of vehicles to a specific location on the map while their opponents must do everything they can to stop them.Retrieval - Breach's version of Capture the Flag places two biological weapon canisters on the map and each team works to retrieve one of the canisters.Team Deathmatch - The standard kill-or-be-killed team deathmatch game type found in most competitive shooters.Sole Survivor - The same as Team Deadmatch, only with no respawning. Once your dead, you're out until a new round starts.Ranking and Online PersistenceThe game features online persistence, where you earn XP and can spend it on weapons, perks, and upgrades, as well as working toward rank upgrades, moving from Grunt through three tiers each of Agent, Operative, Specialist, and Lieutenant before the highest rank, Commander, which is also divided into three tiers.Classes and Weapon Load-outsBreach features five classes typical of contemporary multiplayer shooters, each with their own unique skills and weapons. Each class takes the USP .45 as a sidearm, and below is a list of weapons available to each class:RiflemanWha...I was just going to shoot them!The Rifleman is a mid-ranged class specializing in automatic rifles.Breach ChargeM4A1HK416ACR (Adaptive Combat Rifle)GunnerGunners walk away from explosions.

Luckily members of Atomic Games saw the would-be thief and caught him in the crowd. It was later discovered that he had only copied 14mb of the code.",,,,,,,,,

It was originally released on Steam Early Access on September 19, 2022. It is the first in the series to receive both a digital release and a worldwide release.A revival of the studio's Train Simulator series (after a 15-year hiatus since Railfan: Taiwan High Speed Rail), JR East Train Simulator has players driving passenger trains through parts of multiple JR East lines in Japan. The base game includes a small portion of each of the three initial routes (TÅkaidÅ Line, ChÅ«Å Line Rapid, and Åito Line), and makes use of full-priced DLC expansions for the full JR East sections of those routes.As with the rest of the Train Simulator series, JR East Train Simulation uses high-definition live-action cab footage as full-motion video for the outside view, with the speed of the video playback adjusted for the train's speed to give the illusion of driving a real-life train. Based on the industrial train simulators Ongakukan produced after the release of Railfan, much of the game's physics and soundscape are authentic, with the cab instruments based on official specifications.RoutesTÅkaidÅ Line (E233-3000 series EMU) - Tokyo -> Shinagawa (Basic) -> Atami (Full)ChÅ«Å Line Rapid (E233-0 series EMU) - Takao -> HachiÅji (Basic) -> Tokyo (Full)Åito Line (211 series EMU) - Matsumoto -> Azusabashi (Basic) -> Minami-Otari (Full)The Early Access version of the game included two different routes with short distances, none of which are playable at this time:KeihinâTÅhoku Line (E233-1000 series EMU, southbound) - Omiya -> UrawaHachikÅ Line (KiHa 110 series DMU, inbound) - Takasaki -> Gunma-Fujioka",,,,,,,,,

1440270,Eterna: Heroes Fall Demo,0,Eterna: Heroes Fall,Zu Digital,0,0,1,,"English, Hungarian",,,"Eterna is a citizen science game, supporting research in basic and applied research to predict and design synthetic ribonucleic acid (RNA) structures. RNA, the extremely powerful molecule at the heart of many cellular processes, acts as the operating system of life based on how it folds into complex shapes.RNA research has the potential to lead to breakthroughs in diagnosing and treating dangerous and wide-spread diseases. RNA research may also lead to the development of new technologies, outside of medicine, that are currently impossible through conventional means. However, scientists donât fully understand RNAâs behavior. Creating synthetic designs to carry out a specific function and predicting how well they will perform when created, is extremely difficult - but the diverse community of Eterna players, representing a wide variety of ages, locations, and backgrounds, have tackled this challenge head on, and have done so with great success. The best players still remain better at designing synthetic RNA and solving RNA secondary structures than the best computer algorithms.Through the abstraction of a puzzle/logic game, individuals with no biological or even scientific background are able to make meaningful contributions to areas such as fundamental biochemistry, diagnostics, therapeutics, material design, and more.Players are asked to use RNAâs four nucleotides to design a pattern that will form into a specific shape (or shapes) under various conditions. Over time, these design challenges have become increasingly complex, and reflect a wide variety of mechanics in nature. Initially, players design in a simulated environment for studying and playing with RNA designs that use industry-standard software to predict likely RNA foldings. As they gain experience, players reach the virtual lab and a series of lab challenges. Players create molecular designs for specific biomedical and biotechnology targets. At Stanford University, a partnered wet lab manufactures and tests the designs voted on by the community and provides feedback to the players about how well each design performed. Players then as individuals, and a community, analyze results and use this information to create better designs.",,,,,,,,,

It was later released via Steam on November 4, 2020 and received a port for the Nintendo Switch on March 9, 2021. A mobile version of the game for iOS and Android devices was released on May 17, 2022 as Apex Legends Mobile.A spin-off of the Titanfall series, Apex Legends brings a modern battle royale twist (similar to PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS and the Battle Royale mode in Fortnite) to the fast-paced futuristic universe. As such, some of the series' traditional gameplay elements (including the Titan mechs and wall-running) have been scrapped.The game takes place sometime after the end of the Frontier War (the conflict set in the main Titanfall games), where those in the now-barren Frontier worlds are now making their way to a remote cluster of planets known as the Outlands. Used to spending their lives in conflict, some of its inhabitants participate in a bloodsport known as the ""Apex Games"".Each standard match of Apex Legends features either 20 three-player squads (for the original ""Trios"" mode) or 30 two-player squads (for the post-release ""Duos"" mode), with each squadmate as their own unique ""Legend"", as they scatter for loot and fight to be the last team standing. Similar to other Hero Shooters (such as Overwatch), each Legend has a variety of special abilities to aid themselves (and their teammates) in battle. Players can make use of two unique features to aid them in combat: Intelligent Inventory (an intuitive inventory and weapon management system) and Smart Comms (a contextual ""ping"" system to help communicate with squadmates).As standard with similar free-to-play games, Apex Legends uses a multi-currency system (including ""Crafting Metals"" for common items, ""Legend Tokens"" for rarer items, and premium ""Apex Coins"", the latter of which are usually purchased with real money), randomized loot boxes (""Apex Packs""), and a seasonal multi-tier Battle Pass system for time-limited rewards. Certain characters, mainly newer ones, must be purchased with either Legend Tokens or Apex Coins.Additional characters, cosmetics, weapons, maps, game modes, and quality-of-life updates have been regularly added since the game's original release. Cross-platform multiplayer was later added on October 2020.GameplayCommunicationApex Legends features a robust pinging feature that allows players to communicate in-game through HUD icons and character dialog. A single tap of the pinging button/key will place a neutral marker, while a double tap will call out hostiles in that area. Players can also hold down the button/key to access more options. All items in the world, such as weapons, ammo, attachments, ziplines, supply crates, and more, can be pinged to call them out to squadmates.Battle RoyaleThe standard large-scale survival-shooter game mode, with each match putting up to 60 players in one gigantic battlefield, with twenty squads of three players (Trio) or thirty squads of two players (Duos). Players build up their inventory from items scattered across the map and attempt to win the match by being the last squad standing, as eliminated squads cannot respawn.In this mode, all players start on a dropship flying in a straight path across the map. The squad's automatically-designated ""Jumpmaster"" can, at any time, begin skydiving the squad into the battlefield. The Jumpmaster can also relinquish the role and squadmates can optionally deploy by themselves (or split off from the Jumpmaster at any time).The mode makes use of a feature called the ""Death Box"", where dead players drop a small crate containing all of the items they had in their inventory (rather than scattered around them). Players can interact with the crate using a menu interface, scavenging for weapons, ammo, attachments, and other items. Squadmates can also interact with the crate to recover their Banner Card, which can be used at a Respawn Beacon to bring them back into the match with no items. If the squad fails to recover a Banner Card within 90 seconds of their death, they can no longer be respawned.Ranked LeaguesThe mode is also used for Ranked Leagues, where players spend Ranked Points (RP) to participate in Trios matches (on a particular map) and receive RP for their match placement and kills/assists. Ranked Leagues were added in Season 2 and, beginning with Season 4, reset progress half-way into the Season (known as ""Ranked Splits"").There are six player tiers (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, and Master) and players are matchmade with players of similar tiers, with the top 750 players given the designation of ""Apex Predator"". At the end of the Season, players earn bonus cosmetics for their highest tier placement (with the highest tier granting a special trailing effect while skydiving.Ranked Leagues also make use of abandon penalties, where leaving matches can cause players to forfeit their gained RP (while losing an additional entry's worth) and get locked out from all modes. Players who disconnect due to issues can also receive a penalty if they fail to reconnect within a short time. Players are free to leave once their team is eliminated or once they can no longer respawn. The game also includes ""Loss Forgiveness"", where players on a team with an abandoning player or partial squad do not receive negative RP for the match.MapsKings CanyonKing's Canyon, the original map of Apex LegendsIncluded with the original release, Kings Canyon is a temperate island on the planet Solace with several scientific outposts from the defunct Interstellar Manufacturing Corporation.Its notable features are the Supply Ship (a roaming mobile aerial Hot Zone that travels to random destinations on the map) and Loot Ticks (stationary destructables that can be destroyed for loot).A special nighttime variant was used for the limited-time Shadowfall game mode, and was later used in the map rotation (as ""Kings Canyon After Dark"").UpdatesIn Season 2, the map was revamped after an EMP blast allowed nearby wildlife to invade, causing destruction of certain settlements near the river at the center. Leviathans are monolithic creatures that can raise their feet to expose loot under them, but can kill unsuspecting Legends by stomping down. Flyers are winged creatures that can drop randomized death boxes when eliminated. In addition, new settlements were added, including a six-story structure known as the Cage.In Season 5, the map was further changed after a large chunk of the southwest portion of the map (containing the former Skull Town and Thunderdome) sank into the sea, forming the Broken Coast and its newly-constructed industrial rig (Salvage). In addition, the northeast portion of the map was reworked with a massive rig (Offshore Rig) and an unearthed structure (Capacitor). Leviathans also made their way off the island. This change also introduced Charge Towers (massive glowing devices that, when activated, restores the Ultimate Ability of all players on its platform) and Loot Bunkers (special armory bunkers that unlocked throughout the Season).In Season 8, the map was further changed after a large gunship crashed on the northwestern portion of the map (forming the Crash Site). Slum Lakes was also reworked into Spotted Lakes. Loot Bunkers and The Farm were removed and Leviathans returned. This change also introduces Observation Towers (tall sniper towers which require activation) and Explosive Holds (artillery pods that can be opened with explosive ordnance).In Season 14, the map was further changed after the salvage opration was completed and cleaned up (forming the area Relic).World's EdgeAdded in Season 3, World's Edge is a volcanic area on the planet Talos made inhabitable due to heat-reducing towers. However, the land was made deserted by a lethal flash freeze due to an exploded tower (""The Epicenter"") decades before.Its notable features include Geysers (which launch Legends faster than Balloons), Cargo Bots (which fly around the map and can be downed for loot), and Vaults (which are full of rare loot and can only be accessed through Vault Keys dropped by some Cargo Bots). It originally featured a Train, a roaming mobile Hot Zone that traveled around a specific path on the map.UpdatesIn Season 4, the map was revamped after the arrival of a gigantic structure known as the ""Planet Harvester"", destroying some settlements while splitting Capitol City into two fragments (East and West). It also added a new northern settlement, Survey Camp, which introduce new ""Weapon Racks"" (guaranteed weapon spawns). In addition, this season added Updrafts, where players who jump into lava fissures will be carried back up while taking damage.In Season 6, the map was further changed as Hammond Industries continued developing on it. New passageways and tunnels are added, as well as new settlements (Countdown and Staging) and new usable panels, or ""Blast Walls"", that raise large bridges. The roaming Train was removed, and new broken-down Trains appear throughout the map.In Season 10, the map was further changed as the battlefield is breaking apart due to the Planet Harvester. Refinery, Sorting Factory, and Train Yard has been destroyed (turning into Climatizer, Lava Siphon, and Landslide) and new automatically-running gondolas are added.OlympusAdded in Season 7, Olympus is a utopian city floating in the clouds above the planet Psamathe. However, it was evacuated 40 years after an accident led to the creation of a massive bubble of Phase energy, which has been growing unstable.Its notable features include Tridents (three-seat vehicles for quicker transportation) and the Phase Runner (an always-on Phase portal connecting between multiple areas throughout the map). Later in the Season, Loot MRVNs were introduced that gave loot when charged and interacted with.UpdatesIn Season 9, the map was changed as a large derelict vessel (known as The Icarus) docked on the Crossroads.In Season 12, the map was further changed with a large structure, known as the Phase Driver.

In addition, new types of wildlife (including special Wildlife Nests) can give EVO Armor points, ""smart loot"" (ammo based on the squad's loadouts), and crafting materials when eliminated.UpdatesIn Season 13, the map was changed as the corpse of a giant sea creature (known as the Downed Beast) docked on the shoreline. IMC Armories are also added, allowing teams to acquire smart loot if they survive 60 seconds of Spectre waves.Broken MoonAdded in Season 15, Broken Moon is a colonized chunk of the broken moon Cleo, orbiting above the planet Boreas.ArenasAdded in Season 9, Arenas is a competitive mode where two teams of three engage in round-based combat. Players must purchase all of their starting weapons, gear, and ability charges prior the start of each round (similar to games like VALORANT and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive), and must eliminate all opponents to win.Players win each match by winning at least three rounds, winning two more rounds than the opposing team (similar to the ""advantage scoring"" rules of tennis). On the fourth ""tiebreaker"" round (round 11), the game goes into a faster Sudden Death round to determine the match winner.Similar to Battle Royale, Arenas mode makes use of The Ring to herd players into a specific portion of the arena (which changes on each round). Respawn Beacons and Survival Items are unavailable. Supply Crates are available near the center of the arena, and a Care Package drops (with three pre-determined fully-kitted weapons) after a certain amount of time.InventoryAfter purchasing weapons, players can spend additional amounts to upgrade them in pre-made kits (first for a Common kit, then for a Rare kit, then for an Epic kit). Each upgrade also unlocks their corresponding optics, which can be switched for free. Weapons do not carry over between rounds, and ammo cannot be purchased.Gear that can be purchased include Syringes, Shield Cells, Med Kits, Shield Batteries, Frag Grenades, Thermite Grenades, Arc Stars, and Legendary Backpacks (with the Guardian Angel perk equipped). Players can only carry up to 3 of each Throwable (with the exception of Fuse).While player Abilities are unlimited in Battle Royale mode, Arenas limits the amount of times (or ""charges"") each player can use their Tactical Ability in a single round. Players can opt to purchase additional charges before the round begins. Ultimate Abilities are no longer built-up over time and must be purchased, with most Ultimate Abilities only purchasable once every 1-2 rounds. Any leftover abilities purchased are carried over to the next round.Players no longer start with Evo Shields, instead starting with a Helmet and Body Shield whose grades are determined by the round (Rare for rounds 1-2, Epic for rounds 3+). In rounds 9-11, the Body Shield is Heirloom. Players always start with a Common-grade Knockdown Shield, Epic-grade Backpack, two Syringes, and two Shield Cells. In rounds 3+, players also start with a Shield Battery.MapsUnique to Arenas:Party CrasherPhase RunnerOverflow (added on July 13, 2021)Encore (added on October 12, 2021)Habitat 4 (added on January 11, 2022)Drop-Off (added on March 29, 2022)From King's Canyon:ArtillerySkull Town (added on June 29, 2021)Hillside (added on August 3, 2021)From World's Edge:Thermal StationDome (added on August 3, 2021)From Olympus:Golden GardensOasis (added on August 3, 2021)InventoryWeaponsPlayers can find a variety of weapons in the battlefield, each split into six ammo types (Light Rounds, Heavy Rounds, Energy Ammo, Shotgun Shells, Sniper Ammo, and Arrows).

He worked on the game in his spare time, and it was first released in late 2007. The original game included just 10 levels, and had a timer that would reset the level if it wasn't completed with the limit. Like most games released at this time, it was free.As development progressed, Labyrinth gained many features that helped boost its popularity:an accelerometer calibration menuuser-submitted level packsoptions to remove the level timeradvanced graphics and physicsAfter the increased popularity, the developers removed the full version and replaced it with a demo. They started charging a small fee to activate the demo, which only consisted of 10 demo levels. Suprisingly, this was not met with many complaints, as most fans felt that the app was well worth the price. This, however, did cause some conflict when the full Application was actually released on the iTunes Store July 25, 2008. This was due to users of the jail-broken version that paid for it having to re-buy it again from iTunes. Here's a quote from the developer on the matter:""I would very much like to make it possible to update to the App Store version from the old version but unfortunately it is not possible at the moment. I am investigating different alternatives and talking to Apple about how this can be solved. My best hope now is to be able to issue ""Redemption Codes"" on the App Store.""Labyrinth continues to ride the top of the App store charts, and has received over 2 million total game downloads since it's first release.Labyrinth Light EditionLabyrinth LE is the trimmed down demo version of the full game. It contains only 10 levels. Today, both the demo and the full version are available on the iTunes App Store. The full version runs at $6.99, while the demo is free.",,,,,,,,,

In the game, the player chooses between one of two opossum siblings and is free to explore the various hotspots that exist in the main screen. Some of these lead to small two-or three part animations. The remainder lead into separate screens with educational minigamesMinigamesThe TheaterIn the Theater, the player is tasked with recreating a combination of Character, Action, Setting, and Time, copying a sentence read aloud by a narrator. However, the player is free to create their own scene, which plays to a smattering of applause.There are in total 8 characters, 8 actions, 6 settings, and four times to choose from, with additional props that may be simply added to the scene. The character has the option of saving the scene or printing out a copy.The KeyboardThe Keyboard is a music game where the player attempts to play simple tunes from sheet music using a purple piano. The Piano's range is a standard octave and a third based on middle C. There are 24 total songs consisting of 4 measures each, pulled mostly from folk and classical tunes (e.g. London Bridge, and a Bach Minuet). These can be played on a variety of ""instruments"" ranging from traditional instruments (bassoon or Trumpet) to barnyard noises and a synthesizer voice.The player may also compose her own songs one note at a time and save the score to listen to later.The Keyboard also serves as the access to the computer level.The ComputerThe computer takes the form of a memory game in which the player must pursue a small cyclopean reptile named ""Looks-a-lot"" through a computer landscape complete with oversized resistors and transistors. On each screen, a sound is played and the player must choose the path that pictures the source of the sound (e.g. a dog's bark) in order to continue. Each correct guess provides the player with another note of the first measure of a song from the piano. When the player has enough notes to guess which song is playing, the opossum and Looks-a-lot meet at the entrance and do a little dance while the song plays.The Race TrackThe Race Track or ""Money Game"" puts the player on a game board grid representing a series of city blocks. The player rolls a die to move through the grid, trying to collect colored chips to reach a goal amount before the other player (either a computer or a second person) achieves it first.Upon reaching a tile, the player is presented with a choice of chips presented as a More or Less problem designed to develop math skills.",,,,,,,,,

1439700,Alchemy Absorption: Melody,299,RhinoGearz,RhinoGearz,0,0,0,"Casual, Indie, Simulation",English,,,"OverviewA RPG with puzzle elements developed and published in China, but released worldwide on June 17, 2021 exclusively for Android and iOS devices. Players take on the role of the Navigator (named in-game by the player), who must recruit a team of characters and ""attack"" by drawing lines across connected color squares on the battlefield, to eliminate enemies and progress through the game.StoryThe game takes place on the world of Astra, where The Navigator, one of the last remaining Caelestites alive, is inadvertently rescued by a team of Aurorians. The Navigator uses telepathy to guide the Aurorians out of danger and onto a path that efficiently allows them to defeat their enemies, the Eclipsites. With the Aurorians help, The Navigator manages to get their Colossus skyworthy again, but soon finds themselves drawn into a conflict between various factions of Aurorians and the Eclipsites, who are joined by a traitor who sold out her fellow Caelestites for power.GameplayThe player directs a team of up to five Aurorians spanning up to four different element, each with a pair of skills: one that can be triggered actively between turns, and one that can be triggered after stringing together a Chain Combo. Each round, the player must find a way to string together Chain Combos by plotting a path for their character across adjacent tiles. If the path runs directly by enemies, the squad Captain and any Aurorians matching the tile color element will perform a normal attack on the enemy. After finishing their move, the active Aurorians on that turn will unleash their Chain Combo skill if conditions have been met.In-between turns, the player can switch the Captain of the team up to 3 times, allowing them to take advantage of another Aurorian's Chain Combo skill without worry about an elemental mismatch. The player wins the stage if they eliminate all enemies, though some stages may have different victory conditions, such as landing their party on a specific tile to escape, or surviving an unlimited wave of enemies for a certain amount of turns. The player loses the stage if their party's HP is reduced to 0, or they run out of available turns.AuroriansThe playable characters in the game, most Aurorians fall under one of four elemental affinities, and one of four classes. Players must mix and match their team to play to the strengths of both the map and the enemies being faced. Aurorians can be upgraded with ""Jasper"" to increase their level. When they reach their maximum level, they can be further upgraded through Ascension, using certain resources to reset their level but give them greater stats and a passive ability through their unique Equipment, which itself can be upgraded.ElementsAurorians are either:FireForestLightningWaterUsing an element with an advantage (Fire > Forest > Lightning > Water > Fire) will deal 120% of normal damage to the opponent. Likewise, using an element with a disadvantage will result in only 80% of normal damage to the opponent.At maximum Ascension, a high-rarity Aurorian may gain a second elemental trait allowing them to attack when drawing a path on that color, but their attack will be much weaker for that round.ClassesThere are four main classes that Aurorians fall into.Sniper: Their abilities allow them to target enemies anywhere on the field, from long distance.Converter: Converts other tiles to ones that match their element.Support: Healers and buffers who provide utility to their team outside of raw attack power.Detonator: Powerful AOE damage-dealers that can blow up enemies around them or on a specified grid.",,,,,,,,,

At the beginning of the game, players will need to break rocks against each other in order to craft a hatchet, but with time they will unlock an intricate crafting system that caters for all basic needs, providing them with food, safety, and offensive power.In Zelter the players will meet NPC survivors. If players help them, and take them to the base, they will gladly help upgrade it. The NPCs can be directed to craft supplies, guard important positions, accompany players on scavenger hunts, and help build a fortress, ready to stand against the inevitable zombie attacks.While a zombie apocalypse game, Zelter is still upbeat and colourful. Though the game seems to be in a 2D environment, it actually was created in 3D, as the developers felt that this would allow them to create more sophisticated physical effects, whilst still retaining the retro feel.The game will be released in Early Access on October 22nd..PC specificationsMinimum specificationWindows 10 (64 bit)CPU: i5-4200uMemory: 8GB RAMGraphics: Nvidia GTX 560 or equivalentDirectX: version 10Storage space: 2 GB available spaceRecommended specificationCPU: i7 Skylake or equivalentMemory: 8GB RAMGraphics: Nvidia GTX 860DirectX: version 12Storage space: 4 GB available space ",,,,,,,,,

1438690,Battlefield V Definitive Edition - The Pacific - Key,,,,0,0,0,,,,,"OverviewBattlefield V is the first World War II game in the Battlefield franchise since Battlefield 1943. In addition to the traditional 64-player multiplayer experience headlined by the Conquest game mode, Battlefield V includes a single player campaign, a cooperative mode, and a battle royale mode.By the end of 2018 the game had sold 7.3 million copies but was considered a commercial disappointment. On April 23, 2020, DICE announced the end of content updates for Battlefield V following the upcoming June update.MultiplayerNew FeaturesHealthIn previous Battlefield entries, if the player was injured and managed to escape further injury for a period of time, they could recover to full health.In this entry, the health system is staggered with multiple levels. The player, on their own, can only recover up to a maximum of the current level of health they're in, enhancing the importance of the Medic class and their med-packs. One of these packs can be carried by all players to heal themselves in the field. This can be replenished by a Medic or by interacting with a medic crate.The game introduces significant changes to player reviving. All players can revive their squad mates regardless of their class though medics have a faster animation than other class types.MovementPlayer movement is slightly more robust than in previous entries. Climbing over walls and sliding, introduced in Battlefield 1, return in addition to new features such as crouch sprinting and lying prone on one's back. Nearby V-1 and JB-2 rocket explosions can knock the player to the ground.VehiclesAir and ground vehicles have limited ammo in Battlefield V. On the ground, vehicle ammo can be replenished at resupply stations that can be destroyed and rebuilt by players.

They discover that animals have merged with technology, and that the station is on a collision course with Earth.GameplayThe player controls Evo, a robot who is nothing more than a microchip after an accident in the beginning of the game. Evo can enter the bodies of many animals on the space station, and utilize their abilities to complete his objectives and solve puzzles in order to progress.

1438000,"Gremlins, Inc. â Agents of Chaos",999,"Charlie Oscar Lima Tango Interactive Entertainment, Sergey Pavlov, Alexey Zdorov",The Merchant Guild of Rund (Limited),0,0,0,"Indie, Strategy","English, French, German, Spanish - Spain, Russian, Ukrainian, Italian, Czech, Japanese, Portuguese - Brazil, Simplified Chinese, Polish, Korean",,,"Gremlins, Inc. is a digital board game with card mechanics developed by the Lithuanian-based studio Charlie Oscar Lima Tango Entertainment (stylized as Charlie Oscar). Heavily focused on multiplayer from 2 to 6 players, it features a turn-based gameplay that mixes strategy with some randomness. It also features a single player mode, with specific challenges against characters controled by the AI and custom single player sessions. GameplayIn Gremlins, Inc., players compete to achieve victory points; in order to win a player has to reach a specific score or earn the highest score in an specific amount of time or turns. Each player has a hand of 6 cards (from a deck of 164) which can be used both for moving and for earning different resources such as money, votes, malice or victory points, or for spend said resources to attack other players to make them lose resources, go to Jail or lose victory points. Thus, every card has a value in terms of movement (a set quantity of tiles that the player can move if he or she uses the card to move) as well as a description with the actions that can be achieved with said card.These actions can only be performed in Locations (specific places at the corners, middle points and center of the board) or in Spots, of which there are seven, each one with different effects when players pass through them or stay in them at the end of the turn. Whether you use the card for moving or for acting, it burns away, and there is no option to skip turn. Players can't move freely around the board; thus, every player has to balance between short-term and long-term strategy, carefully deciding which cards use to move and which ones save for later in order to win resources or victory points. Every time a card is used or discarded for some reason, a new one is drawn from the deck.Randomness plays a part in the game in some of the Spots such as Risk (where you can suffer a negative effect if you roll a 1 in a dice) or the Police (where you can be sent to Jail if you roll 1). Those randomness can be balanced if the player agrees in advance to pay an amount of money in order to pass the misfortune to another player or to bribe the police.There are two other key mechanics in the game: players can win votes through cards and special Locations in order to win elections and become Governor. The Governor wins special benefits such as being sistematically ignored by the police and can steal all bribes given by other players. There is a new election every 30 turns, although there are cards that can overthrow the current Governor and precipitate a new election. The other important mechanic is the Jail: players can be sent to Jail with some special cards or if the Police search them and find ""criminal cards"". When in Jail, a player has to choose every turn how to behave (good, neutral or bad), with different events for every kind of behavior. Good and neutral behavior tends to shorten the sentence, while bad behavior can lead to a longer time in prison in exchange of different benefits.SettingGremlins, Inc. is set in a steampunk fantasy world inhabited by corrupt capitalist Gremlins, little mischievous and inmortal creatures that entertain themselves through eternity by competing for money, political power and prestige. This Gremlins are inspired by the folkloric creatures of the same name, commonly depicted as little creatures prone to mischievous pranks. A modern version of this tales depict them as being mechanically oriented, with an inclination to mess or damage machinery. Thus, the gremlins of Gremlins, Inc. live in Clockwork Town, a tiny city inside the gears of a clock.

1437590,Shell Shuffle Demo,0,Victorian Clambake,Victorian Clambake,0,0,2,,English,,,"PlotRin Tsuchimi is your average human high school student. He lives in an alternate world where Humans, Gods and Devils coexist peacefully. He lives with his childhood friend Kaede, as his parents and Kaede's mother passed away in a car accident.Â  Kaede's father, who had been looking after both of them, went away on a long-term business trip, leaving the two alone. One day, the princesses of both the God and Demon realms, Sia and Nerine respectively, arrive in this world with their fathers who have designated him to be their husband. Who's husband, he has to choose. Unable to choose between those two and his childhood friend Kaede, the two princesses move to live nearby (nearby being next door on either side of his house) and attend the same school as him, both trying to win his heart. However, not only does he have the princesses and Kaede, but also Rin's friend Asa. Also, a mysterious demon known only as ""Primula"" appears who also seems to love Rin.  GameplayShuffle! is a standard visual-novel which means gameplay mostly consists of reading the story as told through the eyes of Tsuchimi Rin. Throughout the game, you will make decisions which affect the story and decide which heroine you (Rin) falls in love with. These heroines are Sia (god), Nerine (demon), Primula (demon), Kaede (human) and Asa (human).Â  There are 2 H scenes per heroine in Shuffle! (PC version only).Â  After clearing the game, the player may choose to watch the H scenes again, view artwork for the various characters and listen to the soundtrack of the game.Shuffle! On the StageThe PS2 port of the game, Shuffle! On the Stage was released a year later in 2005. Due to Sony's ruling against explicit adult content on its consoles, all sex scenes were removed. To compensate for this, the storylines of the 5 heroines have been extended.Â  In addition to this, two new paths are available: Kareha and Mayumi.Â  However, there are some inconsistencies with the dialogue which make reference to the sex scenes, even though they supposedly didn't happen.Â Shuffle! Essence  The PS2 port's additional story paths and higher resolution images proved popular. On May 8th 2008, Navel announced the development of Shuffle! Essence  which will be a PC port of the PS2 version. However, as with the previous PC releases, this game will bring back the adult content for the existing characters, but will also add scenes for Kareha and Mayumi (Mayumi having two sex scenes in the sequel ""Really? Really!"" and Kareha never having one before). A release data has yet to be confirmed.Â English Versions There are two current teams working on translating the PC version of the game into English. The first is a fan translation group called ""GamePatch"". This group had been working on a translation several years ago. But, after complications, the group disappeared until July 2009 when the main translator (known only as ""Heklin"") returned to re-form the group to continue work on the project. No release date has been given for their release, though their form has a debate as to whether to release a smaller, more regular patch for sections of the game, or to wait for the final full release. The patch will require a legitimate copy of the original Japanese PC game to work. Â On 4th July 2009, the visual-novel translation company MangaGamer announced that they obtained the rights to translate and release the original PC version of Shuffle! commercially. On 10th July, MangaGamer announced the release date of August 15th 2009 shortly after the announcement by heklin of GamePatch of the reformation of the group. On 31st July 2009, the price was dropped from â¬54.95 to â¬36.95. In a statement, MangaGamer said that the price drop was ""for it to be enjoyed by more customers"".

1437790,Farmer Wars,0,Ritual Interactive,PlayWay S.A.,0,0,0,Action,English,,,"OverviewPrincess Farmer is a match-3 puzzle game developed by Samobee Games and published by Whitethorn Digital. It was released March 31st, 2022, for PC, Xbox One, PS4, and Nintendo Switch.StoryThe story follows the game's protagonist, Princess Farmer, who one day goes from being an ordinary farmer to waking up under the Gaia Tree and meeting Mother Gaia, transforming her into Princess Farmer. As Princess Farmer, she uses her new magic powers to help Mother Gaia pull vegetables from gardens for the citizens and creatures of the world, while also fighting off a mysterious enemy that is transforming people into monsters with strange gummi vegetables.GameplayThe match-3 game board is represented as garden with vegetables buried underground. In order to make matches, the player moves over a column of vegetables and is able to pull up the vegetable that is immediately underneath. The vegetable can then be placed in another column in order to make matches. A total of five vegetables can be pulled up and held at a time.The game's story mode is broken up into nine chapters. Each chapter has an overworld map that is broken up into stages containing a different match-3 board, or an NPC that can be talked to, which often contains dialogue choices for the player to choose from. Match-3 boards are completed by satisfying different conditions on each puzzle, such as making matches of a specific type of vegetable or scoring a certain number of points within a time limit. Some stages also contain a battle mode that involves fighting an enemy in a race to make matches. A form of currency is rewarded based on how well the player did, which can then be used to purchase new cosmetic items.The game can be played in either single player or co-op mode and contains three different play styles to choose from:""Action Bunny"" - A fast paced style that is focused on making a lot of combos quickly""Puzzle Bunny"" - A slower paced style that focuses on just making matches""Balanced Bunny"" - A combination of both modesSoundtrackThe game's soundtrack is composed by Astra Tanuki and was made available to purchase digitally.TrackTitleLength1.PF Theme (2020 trailer music)01:222.the PF VHS collection01:013.Community Barden Groove02:354.bunny dream~02:205.Gaia Valley Morning01:406.goodnight pf <301:147.Chill Forest Afternoon02:128....very mysterious02:299.COWS?!?!?04:2410.Bunbot Beat~02:3511.Carrot Tops03:4012.Tulip's Garden02:4313.Tulip's Garden (cutecore breakbeat remix)02:2614.Rooftop Gardens GONE WILD01:3615.~Magic Forest Beat~03:0316.this isn't chill at all02:3817.Tall, Dark, and Shadowy02:2218.Pancakes!04:1519.shoe gays01:1520.Moonroof03:21",,,,,,,,,

1437060,Outcast in Mars,699,"Ani4Bio  Animated, Isiflix Prod.",Ani4Bio Animated,0,0,0,"Action, Adventure, RPG, Strategy",English,,,"OverviewOutcast focuses upon the misadventures of Cutter Slade, a hard-luck former Navy Seal. A parallel world called Adelpha is discovered, and the U.S. military sends a probe to investigate. However, a Talan native of Adelpha damages the probe, unexpectedly creating a rift in the fabric of spacetime that threatens to destroy Earth itself. Slade is charged with the task of escorting three top scientists to Adelpha to repair the damage and save Earth.Awakening in Adelpha with the hangover of a lifetime, Slade finds himself separated from his team, and mistaken for the Ulukai, the Talans' messiah and savior. Finding the probe will require Slade to earn the trust of Talans across six different regions of Adelpha, and thwart the armies of the tyrranical Fae Rhan, who has used fear and prejudice to turn the Talans against themselves.GameplayOutcast is an action-adventure which emphasizes combat, interaction with NPCs and platform puzzle-solving. While the game does allow for a restricted degree of free-roaming and offers side quests which may be tackled in different orders, the game's story keeps the gameplay fairly linear. A few game-breaking bugs punish players who manage to accidentally experience certain plot-points out of order, but these bugs are rare.Slade must earn the trust of the Talans, who live in fear of reprisal for aiding Slade in toppling Fae Rhan's forces. He builds this trust by helping them with a variety of problems, from locating family members, to cutting off supply chains to Fae Rhan's forces. During his quest, Slade gains access to portals that will wisk him away to other regions on Adelpha, each with its own climate and culture, from the rolling riss fieldsSome islands are best left alone.of Shamazaar to the bustling desert city of Okriana in Talanzaar. Slade's travels are further aided by his trusty Twon-Ha, a bipedal beast of burden ridden like horses.The action takes place in third person, utilizing mouse and keyboard controls similar to other PC-based shooters. Slade has access to a nearly limitless inventory, thanks to a backpack which miniturizes all items for easy storage. When not in the thick of action, Slade can imprint his essence on a crystal called the Gamsaav, which allows the player to save the game. This process takes a few seconds to activate, and will cancel out if the player is attacked, thus requiring the player to be careful when deciding to save.The social interaction takes place through in-engine cutscenes, based upon dialogue trees. Slade's choice of approach can help or hinder him with some of the more skittish locals.Adelpha's RegionsDespite Adelpha being a parallel world to earth, the world itself is considerably different. It consists of six regions, each of which is seperated by large seas of water. Since these waters seem to be impassable, the only way to travel to another region is through the use of portals, which are called Daokas. Each region has a distinct landscape and the inhabitants all have their own unique way of life.Ranzaar - This is by far the coldest region in all of Adelpha. Covered in nothing but snow and ice, and extremely low temperatures, only the hardy Talans can survive here. This is also where the player starts the game and learns the ropes of controlling Cutter.Shamazaar - This is where riz comes from, one of the Talans' largest sources of food. It's also home to four temples, each of which represents one of the essences of the Talan.Talanzaar - A large dessert with only one city, Okriana, which also happens to be the largest and busiest city in all of Adelpha. The city is divided in different areas, called boks, each one with its own form of merchandise. A major portion of the side-quests are found in Talanzaar, and it's also here that players find out more about the obvious absence of women and children.Motazaar - Dry mountainous region where the Talan mine for the precious metal helidium, which the soldiers need for their weapons. Rivers of lava cut through the landscape.Okasankaar - A marsh-like region, with a small town by the name of Cyana. The waters here are extremely dangerous, as venturing too far will cause players to be attacked by sannegtas, which can be best described as mutated sharks.Okaar - Dense forest housing mysterious temples and the crash-site of Cutter's ship. The region is populated by a primitive tribe known as the Oogoobar who do not welcome outsiders.GraphicsOutcast used a software-based voxel engine (similar to that used in the early games in the Comanche series) to produce its rolling landscapes. Superimposed upon the voxel terrain were polygonal buildings and characters, also rendered entirely in software. The game does not support 3D hardware acceleration. An early version of the engine was shown in their 1997 vehicular combat game No Respect.A voxel is a element of a three-dimensional grid (volume-element), in the same way that a pixel is an element of two-dimensional grid (picture-element). Outcast's voxel engine uses height-maps to render terrain. Every element in a height-map stores a depth value, thus it describes a simple volume. The following describes the advantages of using software ray-casting to render these height-maps.The snowy world of Ranzaar, demonstrating the engine's light bloom and particle effects, as well as organic landscapes.The developers elected to use voxel technology to create a world with a more organic feel, as polygonal technology at the time only allowed for rudimentary shapes and most 3D accelerators of the time were ill-equipped to handle additional particle and reflection effects. Outcast's voxel engine allowed for curved surfaces, depth of field and light bloom effects, and realistic snow and fire particle effects. Perhaps most notable was the game's rippling water with refractive and reflective properties that realistically changed depending upon the viewing angle. Many agreed that artistically, Outcast was far ahead of its time.However, the graphics did not come without a price. The game was only capable of running in two resolutions, with a maximum resolution of 512x384, below the 640x480 and 880x600 resolutions that were standard for the time. Even at the lowest settings, Outcast boasted hefty hardware requirements that required players to have the latest in processor technology.Despite the advanced graphics engine, the game was nevertheless maligned by some who criticized it for its lack of support for hardware acceleration, giving some the impression that Outcast represented an inferior product. SoundOutcast features fully-voiced dialogue, which was still unusual at the time for action-adventures of similar scope. The voice acting was considered to be excellent for the time, as was the music, which featured a sweeping orchestral score recorded by the Moscow Symphony Orchestra. The music was further augmented by ethereal choral arrangements and well-placed cues that matched the score to the on-screen action. MiscellaneousDespite poor marketing in the US, the Outcast website featured a wealth of bonus content, including multiple reels of outtakes and bloopers, the latter mimicking blooper reels that are commonplace fodder for DVD releases.The soundtrack was available as Redbook audio on the second CD, and was later made available for download from the website.Based upon rather poor PC sales, a Dreamcast port was scratched. It is unknown how far along in development the title was at the time of cancellation. A polygon-based sequel for the PlayStation 2 was cancelled when developer Appeal went bankrupt; unable to secure funds, the developer closed its doors in 2002.Some of the development team went on to found Elsewhere Entertainment, later acquired by 10tacle and renamed to 10tacle Studios Belgium. Development on a spiritual successor to Outcast, entitled Totems, was eventually halted when 10tacle too was closed.The game was recently released on digital distribution platform GOG.com for $5.99.One of the developers, Franck Sauer, published a post-mortem of the game's development. Open OutcastIn the wake of the cancellation of Outcast 2, a dedicated group of fans took it upon themselves to create their own sequel entitled ""Open Outcast.""The team has created a playable demo called Oasis using the CryEngine. The graphics are significantly improved over the original and all the old worlds plus one new and lots of quests will be featured in an upcoming release.Players will need only a demo of Crysis Wars to play Oasis. No release date has been given. The LanguageThe game designers created a unique language which they used throughout the Outcast. For example, the soldiers often yell ""NÃ©gta!"" which means kill, and Slade is referred to as the ""UlukaÃ¯"": Soul of Essence.The manual of the game contains a dictionary where the words spoken in the game can be found and translated. The list of the words of Adelpha are written below:AAchondar - Dragon-snakeAdelpha - The world of the TalansAdor - RockAfar - After (Soon, tomorrow)AgakamÃ´n - The language of the heavensAgazork - The Talan languageAm - InstanceAtÃ© - How muchBBarr - Evil (bad)Bok - DistrictBoogot - Toxix and explosive mushroomBooyat - Mushroom growing in hot areasBotar - Before (Yesterday)CCyana - City of the marshesDDaguÃ© - Danger, problemDaguÃ©rach - Poisonous plantDammenaÃ¯ - Common little rodentDano - Give (Return)Daoka - Sacred gatewayDarosham - Gateway where spirits are bornDissem - DifferentDolotaÃ¯ - Long timeDoo - Also (again)EEÃ¯ssa! - BanzaÃ¯ (war cry)Eluee - Water EssenceElueen - Those born of WaterEoth - East (right)FFaÃ© - Fire EssenceFaÃ© Rhan - The Master of AdelphaFaÃ©kynn - Those born of FireFaÃ©nÃ©a - Fibes extracted from Gawarats which have healing propertiesFehane - MossG:GaÃ©at - To loveGamor - Carnivorous predator, a cross-between between a wolf and tigerGaamsavv - Stone (saving crystal)Gandha - Earth essenceGadahar - Those born of EarthGanele - SeashellGemehar - Kind of Sanar treeGizhaÃ¯e - Essence BearerGorgor - Big carnivorous animalGuita - FeelGwar - WoundGwarat - CactusGwarta - To nurse (heal)HHÃ¢ - Yes (to be, there are, there is)Hao (HaomÃ©) - Hi (Hello)Hazadess - GhostHazifar - Ventilope driverHÃ©ko - HereHÃ©lidium - Ore specific to AdelphaHokaza - Thank youHorr - HHmm, eh, ahemHoti - TwÃ´n-ha fruits (sweets)IIki - EasyJJinat - To KnowKKa - Air EssenceKaar - Life, LivingKaÃ¯jin - The tale of the heavensKamenaÃ¯ - Designated birdsKamÃ´n - Those born of airKanoon - Well (Good)Kata - BlessKaza - PleaseKazar - Lost prophetKiakii(iii) - FunKo - Who (and direct object, indirect object)KoÃ¯ - What (and direct object, indirect object)Kez - Where (and adverbial phrase of place)(Tar) - When (and adverbial phrase of time)Krakit - Spider-like animalKroax - Leader of the Fae TalansLLabta - To go (travel, move)Lako - ThereLampÃ© - Beer - alcoholLepta - To helpMMadÃ© - HouseMaya (MayamÃ©) - GoodbyeMaÃ© - MeMag - HungerMagta - To eatMaguÃ© - FoodMagwa - Plant with regenerative propertiesMaorr - MasterMarÃ© - Important (very)MeenaÃ¯ - Several (a lot, all)MilÃ©a - HarmonyMÃ´n - RelicsMool - Krakit's salivary glandMotaz - MountainMotazaar - World og MountainsMotÃ© - SomeoneNNani - ExplosiveNÃ© - NonNÃ©dano - stealNÃ© iki - hardNÃ©gta - To killNÃ©kaar - DeathNÃ©ogaÃ© - WoeNoroth - North (high)OOgaÃ© - HappinessOkaar - Forest WorldOkasankaar - World of MarshesOkk - OldOkriana - Main cityÃn - One (number)Oogoobar - Living beings (primitives)Oroth - West (left)PPigweet - RodentPok - Belongings (thing)RRammu - Toxic plantRÃ¢n - WhiteRanzaar - White earthRembat - To rememberRiss - RiceSSan - WaterSanar - Common tree EssenceSangta - To drinkSankaar - FishSankaari - FishermanSankra - ChaosSannÃ©gta - Killer of the seas (sharks)Sayat - To saySem - SameSÃ©yat - To seeShamaz - Designates the Talan priestsSiÃ©nole - Rare plant with hallucinogenic propertiesSodoth - South (low)Solan - DeferenceSota - To buyTTakta - To take (use)Talan - Designates the inhabitants of AdelphaTalanzaar - Populated worldTodar - TodayTrad - MerchantTradta - To sellTwÃ´n - Two (number)TwÃ´n-Ha - Designates biped animal (milk-giving and wild)TwÃ´n-Ha Gui - Biped trapUUlukaÃ¯ - Souls of the EssenceVVentilope - Large flying animal able to be domesticatedWWa - Work / occupation / classWabta - To waitWanat - To wantWata - To workYYo - YouYod - Spirit of the EssenceYod Eluee - Spirit og the Essence WaterYod FaÃ© - Spirit of the Essence WaterYod Gandha - Spirit of the Essence EarthYod Ka - Spirit of the Essence AirZZae - SureZaza - TwerpZeedog - Predatory animal, sedentary and lives in the marshesZonn - FreindZark - EnemyZorkin - Monetary unit used on AdelphaZorr - SoldierZort - ExcrementOriginal System RequirementsCPU Type: Pentium MMXCPU Speed: 200 MHzRAM Required: 32 MBHard Disk Space: 500 MBGraphics Type: SVGAGraphics Resolution: Multiple ResolutionsColor Depth: High Color",,,,,,,,,

1437270,Pleiades - A Subversion Saga Game,799,"Joshua Linscott, 1122 Industries","Joshua Linscott, 1122 Industries",0,0,0,"Action, Adventure, Indie",English,,,"OverviewWhat a floor of a high security building in Subversion may look likeIntroversion, the creators of Uplink, Darwinia, Defcon, Multiwinia and most recently Darwinia Plus have announced that the 5th original title they will be producing will be called Subversion. After years of development where the only details that were released focussed around the innovative procedural generation that will create the world of Subversion, the gameplay underneath it all has now been revealed to centre around performing sophisticated subterfuge in hostile high security buildings. In many ways i t is the spiritual sequel to Uplink with the action now taking place in 3D âreal-worldâ environments rather than from the perspective of a computer console. The developers cite films such as Oceanâs Eleven and Entrapment and the original Mission Impossible TV series as sources of inspiration with the players in Subversion using âSabotage, Social Engineering and Grifting, custom Electrical and Mechanical devices, Distractions, Hacking, Stealth, Acrobatics, Precision demolitions, Trickery, whatever gets the job doneâ.The game is set to be Introversionâs most demanding and enthralling game yet with lead designer Chris Delay declaring: ""Subversion is undoubtedly the most ambitious game weâve ever attempted to create â massive in scope and totally uncompromising in itâs requirements. But every day I work on it Iâm even more convinced - this is the big one, Introversion Softwareâs Magnum Opus, and itâs going to be the best game we will ever make.""What we know so farSubverting SystemsThe world of Subversion is being designed with as many real life systems as possible accurately recreated in the way they function, are dependent on each other and the components theyâre made up from. The purpose of this is to allow the players to be able subvert any system in the game they want in many ways, which will create a high degree of player freedom and procedural gameplay in the process. Subversion is set to allow players mess with different in-game systems on a social, mechanical and electronic level.Confused? As an example, Chris Delay has talked about the ways of subverting a typical sliding door operated by proximity sensors: âFor example â smash one of the Actuators with a hammer, and one of the doors will stay where it is, while the other door continues to open and close. Smash one of the outer sensors and the Actuator will push the door of the end of its slide. Cover the motion sensor with a plastic bag and it wonât send any detection messages to the computer, leaving the doors closed. Stick some chewing gum over the inner proximity sensors and they will think the doors are already closed, thus the control computer will leave the doors open. Push a bin in-between the two doors and they will close on it, and sensors on the insides of the doors will detect this obstruction, and the doors will open slightly, then try to close again. The doors will be stuck in an open/close/open loop, constantly hitting the bin and re-opening, just as youâd see in real life. Cut any of the signal wires, or short-circuit them to set a high or low value. Or just plug straight into the control computer and tweak the status variables in memory, making the system do whatever you want whenever you want. None of these are activities or opportunities that I have explicitly created, but all are possible because Iâve simulated the system in sufficient detail.âDesign AestheticSliding doors ... how will you subvert them?In keeping with Introversion's other games Subversion will not be sporting realistic textures and high-polygon objects. Instead Subversion will feature stylised environments that may bear a resemblance to the look of building blueprints/schematics.Procedural GenerationSubversion's environments are procedurally generatedGroundbreaking procedural generation technology will play a large role in the creation of the gameworld down to small levels of detail. The developers initially released tech demo videos showing procedural generation software which can create a cityscape, complete with roads and a variety of buildings including the insides of these buildings. The procedural generation will allow for the quick creation of varied and complex environments and this will be supplemented in the game by 'hand-made' content for the most important parts of the gameworld that the player will interact with (an example being a procedurally generated office block with one floor being hand-made).User-generated ContentThe developers have spoken out about their interest in the use of user generated content in recent games such as Spore and LittleBigPlanet with the implication that they are considering including something similar in Subversion. It seems certain that Introversion will at least continue their tradition of fostering a strong mod community behind their games so that users can add extra content to the game after release in some way, as has occurred in previously released titles such as Uplink and Darwinia.Updated over time?Chris Delay has talked about Subversion being unlikely to be released initially with the full feature set that Introversion envisions for Subversion, since he says the project is too large for Introversion as just one release given time and cost constraints. How this will manifest itself in terms of release schedule and pricing is unclear and is almost certainly currently undecided by Introversion themselves as they consider other games and developers and the various models they have used in trying to do something similar, e.g. Dwarf Fortress, Burnout Paradise, Team Fortress 2.Background to developmentSubversion has been on Introversion's 'to-do list' for a long time now. Its initial development was started after the release of Uplink and has been worked on and discussed by the team to some degree ever since. It has seemingly been the big project on the horizon for Introversion for a long time, almost too big to take on directly and so has been pushed back continually by smaller projects which have been easier to tackle in the short term. The team have now committed themselves to making Subversion the main focus of their attention now that the Darwinia project for XBox Live has been completed. The only fear now for all those eager to play whatever becomes of the Subversion project, is that Introversion will remain afloat financially until being able to finish it, given that 2008 was a bad year for the company and then Darwinia did not meet their sales expectations and resulted in a number of long-term staff members being shed.Following developmentThe main developer behind the game, Chris Delay (Introversion's creative driving force) was keeping a blog to document the development of Subversion, which can be found here. The blog features an unusual transparency and amount of detail about the game's behind-the-scenes development given how far from completion and final polish it is. A number of videos of tech demos have already been released via these blogs - a recent one is here.These articles recently have stopped updating, with Chris citing a need to stop writing about making Subversion, and just making it instead.",,,,,,,,,

1437030,Silent Mansion : Summoner Part2,699,MINO ENTERTAINMENT INC,MINO ENTERTAINMENT INC,0,0,0,"Action, Adventure, Indie",English,,,"Overview Â Summoner is a third-person RPG developed by Volition and published by THQ. It was a launch title for the Playstation 2, and was released on October 25th, 2000. It was also ported to PC on 19th March, 2001, and Mac OS on 12th July, 2001. It recieved decent scores from reviewers, the PS2 version scoring 74 on metacritic. The sequel, Summoner 2, was released in September 2002.Â  GameplayÂ The gameplay uses fairly standard action RPG mechanics, including a fully controllable, four person party. The player has full control over their parties levelling, able to distribute attribute and skill points where they wish. The combat is a mix of real time and turn based, with the player able to execute 'chain attacks'. These are done by pressing a direction on the d-pad with the correct timing when a character attacks an enemy. The combat system is surprisingly deep, with weapon types factoring into their effectiveness against diffrerent creatures, as well as the weapon's magical affinity being compared to the creatures strengths and weaknesses. Thanks to the joy of a third dimension, having the higher ground in a fight will count in your favour. As you progress through the game, the main character, Joseph, gains the ability to summon creatures as powerful allies in battle. Once summoned, the player can fully control the creature if they wish. There are risks involved with summoning, however. If Joseph happens to fall unconcious while a summon is out, it could turn on your remaining party members, which often results in failure, as well as broken controllers. Alongside the robust combat system, Summoner contains an awful lot of text to read. The towns were fairly large, and most of the NPC's could be spoken to, if only briefly. Main characters often have a lot to say, most of it being important plot information. This focus was a large departure from the usual console RPG's of the day. Most NPC's would also offer sidequests wich offer an abundance of information on the lore of Medeva, the kingdom the game takes place in. The character you team up with through the game also have their own sidequests and storylines.Â  Plot Â Main character Joseph was born with the mark of the summoner on his hand. As a boy, he attempted to use his power to save his village, Ciran, from attack by summoning a demon. He isn't powerful enough to control said demon, which proceeds to kill his family, friends and neighbours while destroying the entire village. Joseph flees and vows to never use his powers again. The vow is (somewhat inevitably) broken when Medeva's neighboring kingdom, Orenia, invades. Orenia's king, Murod, is attempting to find the man born with the mark of the summoner. Joseph's main goal through the game is to find six rings (ligh, dark, earth, air, fire, water) in order to summon a super powerful beastie and defeat Murod.Â Â Extras Â After completing the game and viewing the credits, a computer animated version of the Dungon and Dragons sketchÂ titled ""Summoner Geeks"" plays. It was circulated on the internet as a promotional video before the release of the game. It featured characters from both Summoner and Red Faction.Â  (check out the video here:Â      http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-5331429585309819856# ) Â Â Â System requirementsÂ Â Microsoft Windows   Intel Pentium II or AMD K6-2 CPU    64MB RAM  4x CD drive 800MB hard disk space 8MB DirectX 8.0 compatible video card  DirectX 8.0 compatible sound card     Windows 95/98/ME Mac  300Â MHz PowerPC G3  or better CPU  64MB Ram   8  xCD drive 800MB hard disk  space  Mac OS 8.6 (not  Mac OS-X-native)Â   Sequel A sequel,  Summoner 2,   was released in 2002 .",,,,,,,,,

The player can choose between one of two warring factions in their bid for global domination. It is currently only available for the Xbox 360.PlotAn asteroid has crashed on Earth killing billions of people. Six years later in the year 2031, two factions, the Variant and the Paladin, are at war. The Variant are a single-cell alien bacterium that was buried deep within the asteroid, and was released into Earth's atmosphere infecting half of the surviving humans. The Paladin are the humans who were immune to the bacteria.GameplayThe world is at war!Hybrid is a multiplayer only video game. The main hook is that unlike in similar games (such as Gears of War or Modern Warfare) players are unable to move freely around the environment. Players can either hide at predetermined cover points or can fly via jetpack to another predetermined point on the map. Once in the air the player can evade incoming fire or even change their destination.The game takes place on a âsingle, unified world serverâ that supports thousands of players. The collective goal online is to try to take over territories and continents to achieve global domination. Like many FPS's the game features persistent character upgrades and unlocks, allowing you to access new weapons and upgrades as you play the game. .Squads on DemandThe Warbringer""Squads on Demand"" are bots that the players can summon to assist in combat.

1435950,Creeper Goo,0,Efe Aldemir,Guvnor Interactive,0,0,0,"Casual, Strategy",English,,,"OverviewGameplayGrey Goo features hotkey controls for unit and structure building, but unlike the hotkeys used in StarCraft and many other RTS games, these are based on the WASD keys, with tiered menus that each use the same set of keys.The game is set to be focused on Macro gameplay instead of Micro management. Just like previous RTSes from both Petroglyph's and C&C's past, harvester units will be automated and there won't be any dedicated builder units. Instead, base building will be based around a hub system where new hubs of varying sizes can be placed where the player wishes and add-ons can be built onto them to determine their purpose.Grey Goo will have both single and multiplayer modes. There will be a traditional 15-mission campaign with sets of missions for all three factions. It has already been confirmed that there will be an offline skirmish mode with an AI that is supposedly based off of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) AI theories.Similar to their previous RTS title, Universe at War: Earth Assault, Grey Goo relies on a 3rd party system for its multiplayer setup. However, in Grey Goo's case it will be Steamworks instead of Games for Windows Live (For which Universe at War was actually one of the first titles).The FactionsGrey Goo is set on the planet Ecosystem Nine. On this planet, the three factions of the game end up meeting once again.The HumansBy the time of Grey Goo's events, Humanity has found expansion through the Galaxy to have become too costly- and have internalized themselves to look to their own preservation. They saw themselves as the strongest force in the galaxy, but wished to end their internal wars. So much of Humanity's infrastructure for war has been disbanded, and major decision making has been relegated to AIs to lessen tensions. Now having only an academic-basis of knowledge for warfare rather than actual experience, the Human expedition to Ecosystem Nine must look into this knowledge to defend themselves when they investigate an old signal emanating from the planet.In terms of play-style, the Humans on a basic level innately favor defense and turtling. They have the most versatile walls in the game, since their units can move and shoot through them freely- and they can also relocate their turrets along their conduit lines as necessary. The Humans do have the most constricted bases of the factions though, since all of their structures must be connected to conduit lines to function. The Humans are not without offensive options though. For instance, they can tech up to Teleporter structures that can send groups of 5 units to anywhere they have LOS on the map.The BetaA race of four-armed technologically inferior aliens who have previously almost faced extinction. Their last ship to escape the devastation just barely made its way to Ecosystem Nine. Since then, the Beta have simply been trying to rebuild - and only remember their ancient assailants as 'the silent ones.' Having re-developed almost to the point of resuming space travel, the Beta's prototyping and experiments are suddenly disturbed by the almost simultaneous arrival of the Humans and Goo on Ecosystem Nine. Some in the Beta's command structure are convinced that these are 'the silent ones' with new weapons, but others mention that none of the new assailants match the old descriptions.Gameplay-wise, the Beta are arguably the most traditional and balanced faction in the game- not as fast or aggressive as the goo,but not as innate to turtling as the Humans. They are capable of building their hub structures anywhere they have line of sight, allowing for highly traditional base building and easily-setup proxy bases. Defensively, the Beta have solid walls that cannot be passed or shot through by any side- but can be garrisoned by some of their unit types to act as towers. In fact, one of their unit types, the Guardian, MUST garrison a wall to attack at all. Offensively, their capabilities of building anywhere they have LOS and some upgrades- such as stalkers upgraded with stealth and sniper equipment- give them a surprising number of options for varied attack vectors.The GooThe titular faction of the game, the Goo were originally a force of nanomachines created by Humanity purely for exploration. The Grey Goo was thus responsible for paving Humanity's path through much of the solar system and galaxy, until they determined that such expansion was becoming too costly. At that point, Humanity haphazardly disbanded the Goo in deep space. A century has passed since then, and the Grey Goo has re-emerged as a seemingly re-purposed horde of now self-replicating nanomachines carving a path of destruction back the way they came. The origin of the faction is thus heavily based off of the Science Fiction theory of the same name.The Grey Goo faction is completely based around the Mother Goos. These Mother Goos are capable of moving from one resource point to another as they please in order to grow in health and mass. They can keep their position in constant flux as they split off new Goos of varying sizes that can then form into dedicated combat units. The result is a completely mobile faction with no set base locations or structures whatsoever. The Mother Goos are the faction's resource harvesters, research centers, and unit producers all in one.The nature of the Goo's unit production also allows it to be the most reactionary of the factions, as they can delay morphing the goos into dedicated combat units until combat is joined- at which point a quick thinking player can easily morph them mid-combat to directly counter whatever the opponent has on hand. The goos are also outstanding at ambushes, since the unformed goos can travel over cliffs and elevation without limit- allowing them to break LOS with enemies easily so long as they have no air support. This is made even better by the fact that the unformed goos can serve as vicious melee combatants that eat whatever they can catch. The mobility of the unformed goos arguably partially makes up for the faction's complete lack of air units.",,,,,,,,,

PCF promised that, unlike other ""live service"" games, Outriders would have a complete narrative arc with an actual ending.SettingDuring the middle of the 21st Century, with Earth growing increasingly inhospitable to human life and cataclysmic disasters increasing in frequency, the remaining governments came together under the Enoch Colonization Authority (ECA) to give humanity a chance to survive by finishing two colony ships and travel to a faraway world called Enoch that could support human life. Despite widespread riots, wars, natural disasters, and even a catastrophic engine failure that destroyed the first ship, the S.M. Flores managed to launch on May 2076, with roughly half a million people on board, most of them in cryostasis.83 years later (January 2159), the Flores arrived at Enoch, and a small team of Outriders landed on the planet's surface to scout out potential areas of settlement, as well as signal the Flores that it was safe to start colonizing the planet. The Outriders discovered strange signals emitting from one of the drone pods, but an ambitious ECA leader ignored their concerns and commanded the ship to start disembarking, then tried to burn the surviving Outriders to ""contain"" their discovery. Though the Outriders fought back, only one managed to survive and was thrown in a cryo pod.31 years after that (2190), the Outrider wakes up from cryosleep in an apocalyptic nightmare, where alien storms known as Anomalies and war between the remnants of the ECA and multiple groups of insurgents has pushed humanity to the breaking point. The surviving Outrider discovers that they have been Altered by an Anomaly, and are able to use the alien energies to do things most humans cannot. The Altered Outrider can change the course of history on Enoch, but must survive long enough to save what remains of humanity.ClassesPlayers can choose one of four classes for their Outrider after completing the prologue. Though they cannot change their class once selected, they can affect how their class grows as they progress through the game.TechnomancerA long-range support specialist, the Technomancer uses their Altered powers to create semi-mechanical constructs from Anomalous energies that damage multiple enemies while keeping them out of the Technomancer's range. The Technomancer can regain health as they damage enemies, and can freeze enemies with melee attacks.PyromancerA medium-range class that can work with most weapons, using the power of fire to either singe enemies up close or set entire groups of enemies on fire further out. They can heal when enemies marked by their flame are killed, either by themselves or allies.TricksterA lightly-armored class that uses Anomaly energies to warp the fabric of space-time itself and create bladed weapons that can cut through enemies quickly, with hit-and-run tactics. The Trickster prefers wielding close-range weapons and recovers health and shields when killing enemies at close range.DevastatorA tank class that can take a large amount of punishment and destroy enemies at close range. The Devastator can cause enemies to bleed with their melee attacks, and recovers health when enemies die near them.WeaponsAll characters will be able to equip a maximum of two primary weapons and a secondary pistol with unlimited ammo (though it will still need reloading).System RequirementsPCPC MinimumPC RecommendedOperating System: Windows 10Processor: Intel I5-3470 / AMD FX-8350Memory: 8 GB RAMGraphics: Nvidia GeForce GTX 750ti / AMD Radeon R9 270xDirectX: Version 11Storage: 70 GB available spaceAdditional Notes: 720p / 60fpsOperating System: Windows 10Processor: Intel i7-7700K / AMD Ryzen 5 2600XMemory: 16 GB RAMGraphics: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070, 8 GB / Radeon RX Vega 56, 8 GBDirectX: Version 12Storage: 70 GB available spaceAdditional Notes: 1080p / 60fpsExternal LinksOutriders Official Site",,,,,,,,,

1436040,Guns Boy,199,Luci Entertainment,Luci Entertainment,0,0,0,"Action, Casual, Indie",English,,,"OverviewThe game is an arcade shooter in which either one or two players play as medieval fantasy knights who use modern firearms to kill monsters. Player characters move left and right and can shoot only straight up - which isnât that much of a problem since most enemies spend most of their time in the air.The game features almost 150 short levels in the Campaign mode (including boss levels and optional side levels) as well as 9 levels in the Endless mode.All game modes can be played with either one or two players using local coop.PlotIn a fantasy world a Brotherhood of Knights is led by the Captain and his two commanders. They use a mysterious arcane power, which gives them access to guns, to wage wars against the enemies of the kingdom they serve.During a battle in the capital city the Captain betrays and kills the entire order taking most of the power for himself. His two commanders survive and embark on a journey throughout the world to find their former lord and defeat him. On the way they are helped by the Wanderer, a mysterious man who runs the ingame shop.Game modesKnights and Guns has two main game modes: Campaign and Endless.The CampaignThere are close to 150 levels on the grid-based world map in the âCampaignâ game mode. The players begin on one end of the map and they unlock levels as they move forward.The map is divided into 12 acts, each consisting of 9 levels placed on a 3x3 grid - the players can choose his or her path through and skip some levels he or she wants to avoid.Between the acts are the âportalâ levels in which the players fight a boss or some mini-bosses.On the edges of the map the players will find side levels, which are optional.LevelsEach level has an unique background (with about â of the levels having an original background and â being modified versions of the previous backgrounds).Each level has an objective: kill all enemies, survive for a set amount of time or destroy special crystal enemies within a time limit.Beating a level gets the players a reward of gold.Each level has a set of available weapons assigned to it. At least one of them is always free, and others can be purchased and thus permanently unlocked for that level.Beating a level multiple times with different weapons gives the players golden bullets for that level - after getting 3 of those (or 1 or 2 if the level has less than 3 weapons) the background of the level can be viewed without launching the level.Map objectsSome fields on the map may contain objects and items which can be interacted with.Chests. They can contain gold, lives or armor fragments. They require a key to open.Keys for the chests.Gates: can be opened with gold or by beating the required amount of levels. (Depending on the gate.)Scrolls: contain a picture revealing some of the worldâs history.Gates have to be opened before the level can be accessed.Other items can be picked up after the level has been beaten.EndlessThis game mode allows for continuous play on one of the 9 special levels. Monsters wonât stop spawning and only when the players are dead does the game stop.A highscore for each level is kept - individually for each of the available weapons. Passing certain score thresholds also awards the players with a trophy - bronze, silver or gold.Endless levels are unlocked with gold. Other than that there are no restrictions - this mode can be played regardless of the progress in the Campaign.Meta-gameThe store and goldGold is the main currency in the game.Itâs gained by completing levels, from chests and collected during gameplay itself.It is spent on opening gates on the campaign map and, most importantly, in the store.Consumables: extra lives, full special attack gauge and golden keys for opening golden chests.Armor: new armor for the knights. They change how the characters look and increase their stats. The players unlock new sets of armor by completing acts - then they can be purchased with gold and equipped.Gossip: The only thing players can get in the store for free - the shopkeeper can give them some vague information on various topics.Scrolls: scrolls collected from the world map as well as all the video cutscenes players have seen so far - all of which can be viewed again here.Books: appear in the store for completing acts or found in chests, can be bought with gold. They contain art and names of the enemies.Music: unlocked for completing acts and bought with gold. The players can listen to the entirety of the gameâs soundtrack here.Hall of FameA Hall of Fame with achievements and all kinds of stats can be accessed from the main menu.GameplayPlayer characters can:Move left and right, jump.Dash, moving fast and dealing damage to the enemies. It costs Energy.Shoot.Use the Special Attack. It requires the special attack gauge to be full - players do that by killing enemies.Touching enemies or their projectiles damages player characters. If health drops to 0, the character dies. It can be revived if the players have any extra lives (which can be bought in the store or found in chests on the world map). If thatâs not the case and both players are dead, the level ends in failure.Aside from the monsters the levels might also contain:Platforms.Portals.Traps: Retractable spikes.Cannons and rocket launcher turrets.Stalactites, icicles or spiked metal blocks - all of which fall down on the player when he or she is under them.Pools of acid.Various items can be gathered from the defeated foes:Gold. Dropped by most enemies.Medkits. They restore health points.Elixirs. They fill up the special attack gauge.Speed boost: the character moves and fires faster.Freeze: all enemies are frozen for a short period of time.Special weapons: powerful guns with limited ammo.WeaponsThere are 31 weapons in the game. Their availability varies from level to level. They can be chosen either free of charge, or they could require unlocking first by paying gold.Pistols(Slow, medium damage)Basic pistolAuto pistolHeavy pistolRevolverShotguns(Usually slow, spread fire)Shotgun (weak)Shotgun (strong)Double-barrelled shotgunSawed-off shotgunCombat shotgunMachine guns(Fast, small damage from single bullets)Basic machine gunHeavy machine gunMinigunSniper rifles(Huge damage, very slow)Sniper rifleRailgunExplosives(Hard to aim, large damage, area of effect)Grenade launcherTriple Rocket launcherGrenade shotgunRocket launcherEnergy weapons(Very varied, powerful, rare)Proton rifleSpread gunHyper blasterSlow plasmaPlasma shotgunPlasma minigunPlasma cannonLasers(Straight beam)LaserSuper laserStream weapons(A powerful stream that might be hard to aim)FlamerElectro streamSpecial weapons(Weird weapons with very specific types of firing)ForcegunSuper forcegunEnemiesThere are 26 types of enemies in the game:Abomination (runs on the ground and places traps)Airship (flies horizontally in the air, uses beam attacks)Blade Core (moves around the edges of the screen, shoots)Bomb (flies in diagonal lines, explodes on death hurting both players and enemies)Burster (a spider-like jumper that spits down projectiles while in the air)Cannon Core (a flying bunch of cannons)Crystal Ghost (spawned by Crystal Skulls, they perform a suicidal charge attack some time after spawning)Crystal Jumper (a jumping enemy with no extra attack, on some levels destroying those is the objective)Crystal Skull (on some levels the objective is to destroy these)Daredevil (a parachuter with a suicide attack)Dragonfly (a weak but numerous flying enemy)Drake (a small fire-breathing dragon)Eldritch Crusher (smashes the players if they run below it)Evil Eye (a fast flying enemy that uses beam attacks)Gargoyle (a flying enemy that drops âbombâ projectiles)Ghost (has the ability to phase-out and become invulnerable, has to be watched out for)Incubator (a jumping foe that spawns Dragonflies on death)Metal Crusher (an indestructible variant of the Eldritch Crusher)Metal Slug (a tank-like enemy that stays on the ground and shoots projectiles horizontally)Mole (an enemy that digs out from under the player and jumps into the air)Pogo Knight (a heavy jumper that can damage the player with a shockwave when he lands)Screecher (a flying bat with a cone-shaped attack)Siege Tower (a durable tower which fires at the player with a laser cannon)Snail (a slow ground enemy that spawns Splitters)Splitters (the âbasicâ enemy that has no attacks apart from jumping, but is numerous. Larger ones split into smaller ones on death.)Splitter Spitter (a jumping enemy that spawn a Splitter every time it is hit)BossesFew mini-bosses can be found throughout the game, which are larger and more dangerous versions of ânormalâ enemies. Also, there are bosses - huge enemies on which entire levels are based. The bosses are:The Golem: consists of a head and two arms. Each one of these parts can attack separately and is destroyed separately. The head cannot be harmed until at least one hand is alive. The fight with the Golem is also made harder by the presence of ânormalâ enemies on the level.The Golem also has a darker, stronger variant, which shows up later in the game.The Dragon: similarly to the Golem it has a head and two arms. It has some fire-based attack like breathing fire.It also has a stronger variant which shows up later in the game.The Captain: The main bad guy of the game, he follows the player and uses many different attacks - some of which the players have seen earlier in the game, and some that are unique to him.The fight with Captain has several phases - between these a set of ânormalâ enemies have to be fought as well. And with each phase the Captain becomes more and more dangerous, gaining access to faster and stronger attacks.PresentationThe game uses hand-drawn, comic book style, 2D art for most of its art.Some in-game animations are drawn frame by frame while others use 2D rigging and move/scale sprites.Light sources and particle effects from the Unity Engine are also used throughout the game.

1435390,Brukel Demo,0,Bob De Schutter,Lifelong Games,0,0,1,,"English, French, Italian, German, Spanish - Spain, Dutch, Russian, Turkish",,,"OverviewBrukel is a first-person exploration game developed and released digitally by Lifelong Games for the PC on November 3, 2019.The game was designed by Bob De Schutter and takes place in a fictional version of the Brukel farmhouse, a Belgian farmhouse originating prior to the 1300s that was also the parental home of his grandmother Bie Verlinden. To develop the game, De Schutter interviewed his grandmother for over 5 hours as she reminisced about her life at the farmhouse. These stories provided the foundation for the game and most of its spoken audio.De Schutter has referred to this method of game development as gaminiscing - or using the tools of video games to share authentic personal history - and hopes that Brukel will inspire other game designers to follow its blueprint.GameplayPlayers enter the Brukel farmhouse playing as De Schutter, who is aiming to take pictures of a some of the objects in the house with his smartphone. Whenever an object that Verlinden has a story about is photographed, players can listen to it (similar to how audio logs function in games such as Gone Home or BioShock). The stories cover topics such as Belgian farm life in the 1920s as well as the background of the family. As players look for the objects on De Schutter's list (as well as several hidden ones), they explore the house and time progresses.After midnight, however, a locked door in the house sways open and players are allowed to enter the stable area. At this point, the photography mechanic is abandoned temporarily as the game transforms into a psychedelic horror experience similar to games such as Layers of Fear or Silent Hill. Players now find themselves in a nightmarish version of the Brukel farmhouse where Verlinden's traumatic war stories are brought back to life and rooms change position.The game features ghosts, in particular several German soldiers, an (invisible) English officer and a female figure that can be interpreted as either Verlinden's older sister Bertha or Verlinden's mother (although the game's credits refer to her as Bertha). They guide the player through the war stories as Verlinden narrates them. During these scenes, the player has to solve light puzzles to avoid death.Easter EggsBrukel contains a number of easter eggs, some of which unlock achievements in the Steam version of the game.",,,,,,,,,

Depending on where they stop bouncing, their size varies. For example, if the ball ends up in a corner, it will be relatively small. If it ends up in an open space, it can be huge. Players fire the cannon from the bottom of the screen and if thee ball bounces back, crossing the red line that's in front of the cannon, it's game over.Once the ball expands, a number appears in the center of it. This number corresponds to the number of times that players must hit it before it disappears. Each ball starts with the number 3 in the middle. The fact that balls can only be eliminated with another ball creates an endless chain of balls. The way that balls are eliminated depends on the game mode.Game ModesGravity ModeHere, each ball serves as a planet with its one center of gravity. When players fire the ball, it will be attracted to the other balls. The strength of the gravity depends on the size of the ball; balls are attracted to bigger balls, this means they can be eliminated faster.Pure ModeA mode with no gravity in play; players only must hit the other balls to make them disappear.Super Nova ModePlayers directly control the canon. A laser shows where the ball will end up, but since there's gravity in play, players must take into account that what they're being shown may not be the actual path of the ball.Two Player ModeA mode that allows two players to play together.",,,,,,,,,

1434860,Isle of the Conjured Demo,0,VTA Games,VTA Games,0,0,0,,English,,,"OverviewThe Isle brings dinosaurs and humans together after an experiment horribly backfires. Players can choose to play as dinosaurs (carnivores or herbivores) or various human factions. Players can choose to form a pack to try to stay alive and hunt together, or players can run solo and sabotage bases and gangs. Unlike many other dinosaur games, The Isle brings back the sheer terror of dinosaurs. Austroraptors can be crouching in the brush without anyone suspecting; A Carnotaurus can charge through foliage, outrunning everyone they come against; or a Tyrannosaurus Rex can give a might roar for all to hear. Running and shooting at close ranger against a T. Rex will get you killed.The Isle was Greenlit on Steam on May 29, 2015 in just 5 days - making it one of the fastest greenlit games to hit the steam community. DinosaursThere are currently 5 dinosaurs, with 4 being in the playable demo. They are: Tyrannosaurus Rex, Carnotaurus, Gallimimus, Austroraptor, and Puertasaurus (not playable in the demo).A unique idea coming to The Isle are dinosaur strains. Each dinosaur (limited to carnivores - not likely released for Early Access launch) will have various strains: Tissoplastic, Neurotenic, and Hyperendocrin. Each strain will bring different abilities for player to use against enemies - from stealth to tank-like size and armor.The dinosaurs come from Vlad Konstantinov (http://swordlord3d.deviantart.com/). The dinosaurs were previously used on The Stomping Land, but after failing to receive payment, Vlad was contacted by The Isle to buy his work. The Isle now has an exclusivity clause with Vlad for all of his dinosaurs (except the Anklyosaurus). Human FactionsThree human factions are still in the concept phase: Rangers, Scavengers, and Poachers. These factions will not be playable at the start of Early Access Launch.   CannibalsThe Isle is not for the weak of heart. Cannibals roam the land with bone weapons hiding in the dark. Cannibals brings a third option for players to use. They are quick, agile, and are not afraid of anything - especially dinosaurs. These mutants are known to use every part of their victim - from weapons to threatening totems.    Cannibals also have the ability to ride dinosaurs. They punish these beasts into obeying and mangle them to fit harness or saddle. While the dinosaurs obey their riders it's is not to be confused as obedient.DevelopmentDevelopment for The Isle started December 2014. Development has been streamed on Twitch (twitch.tv/thedondi) showing maps being built and various animations for each dinosaur.

Lorraine has lost her son, Callum, and must traverse the park in order to find him.Atlantic Island Park is on Solomon Island, off the coast of Maine, from the MMO The Secret World. The amusement park itself can also be seen in The Secret World as a location in which the player can complete quests. GameplayThe Park is a first person exploration adventure game where the players interaction with the environment is limited to finding documents to read, listening to the soliloquies that Lorraine will sometimes give as you walk, and riding creepy amusement park rides.It is a game mainly focused on storytelling so there is no combat and very little in the way of puzzles. As Lorraine, the player is mainly tasked with moving forward, and discovering items that explain the story further while Lorraine occasionally gives her own backstory.The player can also have Lorraine call out for her son which gives a slight hint as to which direction you should go if you are lost. DevelopmentThe Park was developed as part of a new business strategy by Funcom. After announcing financial troubles in August of 2015 they then announced they wanted to look into developing small scale, experimental, and innovative titles with their existing IP. They would do this in order to develop their team's ability to create different kinds of games as well as gauge market interests.The Park is the first title with this idea in mind.The Park released on PS4 and XBOX one on May 5, 2016.

1434110,Freelancer Life Simulator Demo,0,DiamosDev,DiamosDev,0,0,0,,English,,,"Story MechanicsNPCs at the barFreelancer's story, shown in two hours worth of in-game cut scenes, only exists in single-player mode.The story is linear without any branches and can only be advanced when the player takes on key missions one at a time. There are no time limits to complete these missions, and the player can ignore and ""pause"" the story to take on side missions instead. To prevent the player from amassing too much wealth and equipment on the side and making the key missions too easy, the current key mission must be completed before the player is allowed to advance a level.PlotThe opening scene when starting the single-player mode shows the destruction of space station Freeport 7 by unknown forces. The player assumes control of one of the survivors, Edison Trent, who is now without money or a ship on the planet Manhattan. Trent takes up employment with the Liberty Security Force while waiting for associate to wake up from a coma in the hospital. His contact in the LSF is Commander Jun'ko Zane, who provides him with a small basic starfighter. The main story involves Trent discovering a conspiracy and a cover up concerning what really happened on Freeport 7 and why it was destroyed. Trent quickly discovers that all of the survivors from the station begin to vanish or are found dead and has to do what ever is necessary to make sure he does not meet the same fate.GameplayShip's HUDThe player has several options in regards to how he or she builds wealth and power in the Freelancer galaxy. One can be a fighter pilot for hire, a space pirate, a bounty hunter or the captain of a cargo vessel. Different jobs are accepted by conversing with NPCs or checking out the job board at planetary bars. Every mission, regardless of type, takes place in space. The player may also purchase more advanced ships as the game progresses. Each ship has different attributes which may or may not be useful to the player.Freelancer's flight mechanics were made to be novice-friendly and thus controls over the facing of the ship are controlled by the cursor while engine direction outputs are controlled by the typical W-S-A-D keyboard layout; however joystick control is also supported.Credits (Economy)The player gathers credits by completing missions given by NPCs. Missions that provide less assistance from other A.I. ships and with more enemies will provide a better payout.Trading is also available as an option for earning credits through the universe's markets, although the economic system in Freelancer is very basic. The markets are always steady and can not fluctuate because of the player's actions. The price of an item in on one planet may be higher on another. Therefore it is in the players best interest to shop around before buying or selling goods.Mining is also another way of creating an income however it is not the most efficient; the player will have to go to a marked mining field on the navmap and shoot at debris floating by the ship. Earth minerals and other strange alien minerals can be mined from the debris and the player can tractor these materials into their cargo hold.With the credits, players can buy equipment, ship parts, ships, weapons and ammunition.ShipsIn Freelancer, the player can pilot single person ships only; there is no option to pilot capital ships. Also, the player is limited to owning only a single ship. Each ship has a certain number of hard points for upgrading the ship. Each ship has a limited number of spaces for weapon hard points, and each type of weapon has a class assigned to it. Depending on the class, some ships can not use the higher class weapons. There are also hard points for engine improvements, and for shields. In Freelancer, there are different varieties of shields that have strengths and weaknesses to different types of weapons. There are also different classes of ships, such as bombers, which are slower, heavily shielded and heavily armed. Bombers are ideal for taking out capital ships and stations. Fighters are more suited to fighting bombers and other fighters. Freighters are ideal for the player who likes to trade commodities to earn cash. There are variants of these classes, such as heavy fighters, light bombers, etc.Interplanetary TravelNavigating on the map is a very easy task, as the player will only need to click on a location he would like to go and click on a waypoint button to plot out the most efficient way of getting to their destination. Each vessel is equipped with autopilot to make long voyages easier on the player. The player can also manually pilot their ship to any location in the three dimensional world. All ships are also equipped with cruise engines which are faster than standard maneuvering thrusters. When cruise engines are engaged, weapons are not available due to extreme power requirements. Ships can also fire missiles that can temporarily disable a ships cruise engines.Players travel from location to location through trading routes which accelerate the player's ship to near light speed, thus eliminating long space voyages.Official jump gates are man-made, allowing easy and fast transit between solar systems. These are usually guarded by the local police force or military. Some of the jump gates are off limits to players until they have acquired the access codes to the gates. There are three types of jump gates in Freelancer. There are system to system gates for interplanetary travel, region gates for traveling between vast distances, and there are also natural jump gates found in the galaxy, usually in dust clouds and other places. These can only be found through either exploration or through buying the information from NPCs at bars when they are willing to help you.In all there are 7 regions of space to explore in the Sirius Sector, which are:The StarmapBretonia, a British-themed clusterLiberty, a North American-themed clusterRheinland, a German-themed clusterKusari , a Japanese-themed clusterIndependent WorldsBorder WorldsEdge WorldsFactionsOne of the most touted features of Freelancer before its release was its numerous factions and their interactions with one another. For example, fighting with the Blood Dragons might please the Golden Chrysanthemums and the Corsairs, you'll anger the Kusari Police and the Hogosha. While these complex faction interactions are in the game, the rough territory of where each faction can be found does not ever change, despite how many raids the player may run. This renders some factions, such as the Xenos, almost nonexistent in terms of gameplay.Better relations with factions can be bought through bribes. As well as buying cargo, weapons and ships from a faction which can increase your standing with them. This often leads to traders being very friendly with corporations and police while hostile with pirates. Factions will also not sell you items or even talk to you in the bar areas if you do not have enough standing with them.MultiplayerWhen Freelancer was released, Microsoft maintained several official servers for players to use. All of the features in the single player game were present in multiplayer, though some story-specific regions of the game were locked off. All servers were persistent, maintaining a player's stats and progress on that server only. Clans were also common, often setting up on a particular server where they would compete with other groups. Custom servers were also present, with small server-side modifications to allow the player to have access to story-specific regions, start off with more credits, and usually more accommodating to clan activities. Many of the major mods of Freelancer also ran their own servers, which were often more frequented than official servers. Such servers often put a greater emphasis on role-play and/or combat and usually had a parallel forum or site where players could interact with one another.On April 8th, 2008, in accordance with the completion of its five year commitment to the title, Microsoft ended official support for the game and shut down the master server list, though some communities continue to maintain their own servers.Development and ReceptionFreelancer was developed by Digital Anvil as a sequel to Starlancer. While sharing the same story background as Starlancer, Freelancer was to be a free roaming space simulator, as opposed to the more linear, mission-based structure of Freelancer. Like Starlancer, Freelancer was notable for the involvement of Chris Roberts of Wing Commander fame. Roberts envisioned many bold features for Freelancer, notably a persistent and dynamic world and economy which would react to the player's choices. The game was formally announced in 1999 with a tentative release date of Fall 2000, though was later pushed back to the end of 2001 due to the game not nearing completion. In June of 2000, Microsoft acquired Digital Anvil and Chris Roberts left the studio as well as his leading role in developing Freelancer, though stayed on as a special consultant. Microsoft then instructed Digital Anvil to scale back the scope of the project and finish on releasing the game in a stable state.For the following months, Freelancer was largely under the radar, and was believed by some game sites to have become vaporware. In October of 2002, Digital Anvil finished development of the game, opening up beta testing and fixing remaining bugs, finally being released on March 4th, 2003. The game's only patch was later released the following June, and afterwards much of the game's support was handled by Microsoft Game Studios.The game was received well by the gaming press, but most critics noted that the game fell short of the ambitious promises made by Chris Roberts when it was first announced, particularly the game's static economy as opposed to the promised dynamic world. Others criticized its uninspired plot and the lack of diverse voice actors beyond the main single-player characters. Despite its dated graphics engine, praise was given for the game's visuals, especially in space. On Metacritic, Freelancer holds a favorable 85/100 rating, calculated from 39 reviews.ModdingFreelancer was very modder friendly, resulting in a vibrant modding scene that lasted well beyond the game's initial release. Mods ranged from smaller tweaks to the game's features to large scale changes to the gameplay and addition of new sectors, factions, and ships, sometimes from other science fiction properties like Star Wars. Larger and more ambitious mods focused on making the multiplayer end of the game more dynamic and player driven, attempting to reach the original vision of Freelancer. Some of these features included things like player-owned stations and capital ships, a server-side dynamic economy, and enhanced combat.A popular demand by modders is that Freelancer's source code be released in order to allow for more flexible modding, though Microsoft has given no indication that Freelancer's code will ever be released.SoundtrackFreelancer OST's front coverFreelancer's original soundtrack was composed by James Hannigan & Andrew Sega.#Track NameLength1Liberty Space Suite4:042Bretonia Space Suite4:113Rheinland Space Suite6:034Kusari Space Suite4:115Omega Space Suite4:046Omicron Space Suite4:107Sigma Space Suite4:258Tau Space Suite4:069Ind.

1433120,STAR WARSâ¢: The Old Republicâ¢ - Public Test Server,,,,859,859,0,,,,,"OverviewStar Wars: The Old Republic is an MMORPG from famed developer BioWare based in large part on their highly acclaimed Knights of the Old Republic franchise. The Old Republic takes place approximately three hundred years after the events of the first two Knights of the Old Republic games. The Old Republic aims to maintain the core gameplay and principles of the previous Knights of the Old Republic games in a new large online environment.Players choose to join either the Sith Empire or the Galactic Republic at the beginning of the game. The player can make choices throughout the game will influence and determine their alignment towards good or evil, otherwise known as the light and dark sides of the force. BioWare has mentioned that they hope The Old Republic will be structured in a more story driven fashion than most MMORPGs, allowing players to carve ""their own epic stories"" within the galactic turmoil of the game's setting. The Old Republic will feature many common MMO aspects such as crafting, guilds, and PVP.The game also features a Mass Effect-style dialog wheel, which lets players make dialog choices. The game features full voice acting including the player character, companions and other NPCs (Non-player characters). With notable voice actors such as Lance Henriksen who will voice the Jedi ""Master Gnost-Dural"", BioWare claims the amount of voice work is 10 times the size of KOTOR or 40 novels' worth of content.The art direction of The Old Republic is a blend of realistic and more animated styles, without leaning to the extreme in either direction. The reasoning behind this choice is to give the game a unique appearance without making the system requirements too extreme, allowing it to run on as many computer systems as possible.Star Wars: The Old Republic was officially announced in a live press conference held at LucasArts headquarters in San Francisco, California, on October 21st 2008. The game was released on the December 20, 2011 in North America and Europe, for PC only. It is scheduled for a March 1st 2012 release in Australia.SettingStar Wars: The Old Republic takes place three hundred years after the first two Knights of the Old Republic games with a new setting and story while still maintaining some similarities with the previous games in the series. At the end of the first KOTOR game Revan disappeared to try and locate the hidden Sith threat he felt in the Force from beyond the Outer Rim; he never returned, instead a new and stronger Sith Empire emerged led by an unknown Emperor.For centuries the Sith Empire plotted patiently in an unknown sector of space where they gathered their forces to launch an attack against the Galactic Republic, specifically the Jedi Order. With a surprise assault the Sith's armada of ships and soldiers launched a devastating attack against the Republic and captured many planets within the Outer Rim. In particular, the water world of Manaan, featured in previous KOTOR games, was attacked though it was considered neutral toward the Republic. Its inhabitants, the Selkath, were forced to flee from their cities on the waters surface and continue to live in its dark depths.As the war raged on, the Sith sacked and destroyed many planets as they made their way toward the capital of the Galactic Republic, Coruscant; the Sith then launched an attack on the capital. With enemy forces standing at their front door the Republic Senate was forced to sign the ""Treaty of Coruscant,"" the details of which are scarce. It is known that the treaty required the Republic to withdraw its support in all forms from a number of planets that were strong and loyal supporters of the Republic. Now it appears that both factions have come to an uneasy truce and the galaxy is once again in turmoil as fear and uncertainty have taken grip of the people. The motivations of the Sith Emperor himself are unknown, much like his identity, but while he continues to carry out his mysterious plans the crippled Republic is struggling to rebuild and repair the damage from the devastating Sith attacks.Relying less on the Jedi for military support, the Republic has focused on building up its own force of highly trained and skilled soldiers to continue its fight against the Sith and their Empire. Taking over the major roles on the battlefield, this new army of Republic Soldiers has become the backbone of the Republic's military. The Jedi have abandoned their destroyed temple on Coruscant for the recently rediscovered planet of Tython where the Jedi Order was founded, but they remain dedicated to protecting the people and morals of the Republic from the Sith Empire.However, the uneasy truce that was signed between the two great factions seems to be close to a breaking point, as minor skirmishes between the Sith Empire and the Galactic Republic are occurring more regularly. It seems that once again the galaxy will be plunged into full scale war. Now it is up to the player to choose their destiny and decide which path they will follow to restore peace and balance amidst the turmoil.Story and Character DevelopmentThe stories in The Old Republic are based around the class a player chooses. Each class has its own unique story line with a vast array of choices that will give each player a personalized experience. BioWare hopes to set the system up in a way that allows a player to go through the game as a Jedi, then start a new game as a Sith and never experience the same cut scenes or story arc. The plot is epic tale of either saving or destroying the galaxy and each quest is designed to have a feeling of grand scale, no matter how far you have progressed in the game. The game's developers often push the idea that The Old Republic has enough story lines in it to qualify as Knights of the Old Republic 3, 4, 5, 6, and so on.Players acquire multiple companion characters over the course of their career. Despite being able to have more than one companion you may only travel with one at a time. These characters grow and develop based on the choices you make, and you may even have the opportunity to form a romantic relationship with your companions. Companions can have either positive or negative reactions to your choices and will offer their own specific companion quests you can then complete to strengthen your bond with them but if you anger them enough there are as yet unconfirmed repercussions. In contrast, certain companions are romance-able if you gainAt the start of the game you choose between two factions, the Sith Empire or Galactic Republic. However this doesn't necessarily mean you have chosen a good or evil path to follow. The game will offer various choices and decisions for the player to make throughout the game which will ultimately determine their character's position on the light or dark side of the force it has been confirmed it will also be possible to walk a ""neutral"" path for those so inclined. These choices will have an impact not only on your personal story and companion feelings but also on certain character abilities, to what degree and how has not yet been announced.BioWare has confirmed that players will get to find out what happened to Revan after the ending of the original game. HK-47 also makes an appearance.ClassesThere are four classes on either faction. Each class directly correlates with a class on the opposite faction, with only minor differences between them mechanically (A Smuggler, for example, uses blaster pistols, while an Imperial Agent uses blaster rifles). Each class has a unique class quest chain that will last the length of the leveling experience. Each class has five exclusive companions. At around level ten, players are able to pick an ""Advanced class"" which can only be chosen once, and will radically effect how you play. Advanced classes are then further customizable depending on which of three skill trees you pick (though these can be changed later on, for a fee). One skill tree is shared between advanced classes.RepublicTrooperConcept of the Trooper classStarting planet: Ord MantellRaces: Human, Cyborg, Mirialan and ZabrakStarship: BT-7 ThunderclapVoiced by: Brian Bloom (Male), Jennifer Hale (Female)As the name suggests this class is an extremely tough class, who wears the heaviest armors available.

Years ago the massive corporation of Czerka decided that the planet may be rich in minerals and decided to set up a massive mining operation on the planet in hope of strip mining it clean of anything it was worth. However, they soon came to realize that there was nothing to find by mining, but that the planet did make a great place to test and develop biological and advanced weapons in secret.However, due to some unknown reason, Czerka corp abandoned its weapon development facilities out of the blue and simple left them hidden in the sands of the planet to be consumed by the desert. Seeing it as an opportunity to find some powerful technology left behind, the Sith Empire has decided to take control of a spaceport that a band of Jawas had restored in hopes of creating a hub for trading with travelers, and are now using it as a launching point to search the planet for these hidden research bases.CoruscantCoruscantIn the fiction of Star Wars, Coruscant is the center of the galaxy and is host to thousands of alien species, as well as being the capital world of the Republic. During the time of this game, Coruscant has been nearly destroyed by the invading Sith Empire. It is yet unknown how big of a part this world will play in the game, but being host to many different levels of poverty and crime on one planet makes it a perfect fit for many interesting adventures and stories. From the highest ranking government official to the lowest criminal scum in the galaxy and every thing in between Coruscant has it all.BalmorraBalmorraSoon after the planet was colonized, Balmorra joined with the Republic and found itself attracting a wide rage of major corporations, which lead to it being known as a leading planet for all things droid and weapon design and manufacture. This, of course, drew the Imperials to the planet to gain control over it and all the resources its control offered. It wasn't long before the Imperials ran the Republic forces off the planet, leaving it in their control; or so they believed. With mounting pressure on the Republic's war efforts elsewhere, they where forced to abandon the planet to the Imperials with only enough manpower for a small group to help with a growing resistance on the planet.However, with recent turn of events in the current war being fought, the Republic have since taken interest in the planet again and have sent more troopers in an effort to retake the planet. However, with much of the native populace feeling negative toward the Republic for what they perceived as betrayal for leaving them before, the Republic have not been meet with as much cooperation as they had hoped. This has lead to the planet becoming another one of many war torn worlds that have been turned into a battleground with a constant flux over who has control, despite both sides continuous efforts to regain total ownership of the planet and its resources.TythonTythonThis planet is the location that the force was first discovered and harnessed by a humanoid species. As the birth place of the Jedi, it is believed to hold many long forgotten secrets of the force. It is a lush forest-like world that will be host to many an important events in the near future, as well as being the starting location for new players in the game.KorribanKorribanKorriban was the home world of the original Sith species. However, after the Hundred Year Darkness, the fleeing Jedi that would eventually make up the future Sith empire landed on this planet. Over the years they used their amazing talents with the force to mesmerize the Sith species and they soon became worshiped as gods by the Sith people. After many years of rule over the Sith people, the fallen Jedi began to interbreed with the Sith species and eventually the two became one single being that formed the Sith Empire. In years to come, the Sith created giant tombs to honor and encase their most powerful leaders. When they died, their powerful teachings in the form of Holocrons -- as well as artifacts of great power in the dark side of the force -- where in cased in each Sith Lords tomb. In years to come, the tombs would be pillaged and all of the most powerful of the artifacts would be stolen and lost to time by desperate scavengers looking to make a fortune. It is believed that this planet will be the starting location for the Sith Warrior class in the game as seen in the most recent videos released by BioWare.HuttaHuttaHutta means Glorious Jewel in Huttese the language of the Hutt species. It is home to some of the galaxy's most powerful crime lords, as well as what many consider to be the most vile greedy and disgusting species in the galaxy. Originally the planet was inhabitable by the Evocii people, but they were overrun by the Hutt species, and had their planet strip mined by the Hutt people for resources to feed their insatiable greed. It has left the planet a putrid toxic wasteland filled with stagnate waters, toxic seas, and an atmosphere polluted by factories.Ord MantellOrd MantellOrd Mantell was a planet that was founded by a group of Corellian colonists and was converted into a military base for the Republic. However a corrupt Republic admiral sold the republic fleet that was guarding the planet and it was soon over run with criminal organizations. It soon because a planet of lawlessness and was over run by slicers, bounty hunters, smugglers murders and drug dealers. Despite this the planets government wanted to stay loyal to the republic and eventual rejoined them. This lead to various factions on the planet rebelling against the government wanting independence form the Republic which caused a civil war to break out.AlderaanAlderaanAlderaan has always been a member of the Galactic Republic that spoke of peace and understanding rather then of war and violence. Because of this many of the Republic saw Alderaan as the heart and soul of the Republic, so when the Empire invaded and quickly overwhelmed the planet it wasn't long until they where meet with a ferocious army of the Republic hell bent on taking it back. However with the attack on the planet the leaders of Alderaan soon became angered and bitter, and for the first time began to speak of war and revenge in the senate because of the Imperial occupation.When the treaty of Coruscant was signed the prince of Alderaan stormed out of the senate, and soon there after had announced that Alderann had seceded from the Galactic Republic and that it had become its own independent system. This lead to a very mixed reaction from among the Alderaan people and leadership, which eventually lead to a knife in the back for the Prince, and his wife dieing a few days later. This event caused a power vacuum in the leadership on Alderaan that soon caused a civil war to break out amongst noble houses fighting for the right to leadership of the planet. To make maters worse a forgotten house has shown up claiming right to the thrown that is allied with the Imperial armies, while the Republic continues its support for the house of Organa.VossVossVoss is a planet discovered by accident shortly after the Treaty of Coruscant, its rocky plateaus, unspoiled peaks and verdant forests were at first inhabited only by Gormak, a tech-savvy but pre-space flight species of extremely hostile natives. The second species to inhabit the planet were the Voss - mystics that are hightly skilled in the use of the Force. Ever since the Voss arrived, they've been fighting a loosing war against the natives and when the Sith and the Republic came in they mysteriously vanished.BelsavisBelsavisWhat was once considered an unremarkable world this planet was discovered to be a prison world for the Rakatan Empire. With the galaxies worst in statis the Republic set up its own prison on the planet. After imprisoning some of the worst enemies of the Great War, Imperial agents discovered the secret prison and sent a strike force to release them. The world is now in complete chaos as the thousands of prisoners including Sith Lords and Mandalorians battle across the planet.HothHothBest known for the Battle of Hoth in 'The Empire Strikes Back'. Once a remote and forgotten world, it is a spaceship graveyard after a massive battle in the Great War. Littered with hundreds of ships from both sides, the planet is the resting place to some of the most powerful ships of the war, including several prototypes the Republic used to turn the tide of battle. After the war pirates took over Hoth to salvage what they could, however after the treaty of Coruscant both Republic and Sith forces have returned to claim the wreckage. The world is now a battlefield of both superpowers fighting to the bitter end.TarisTarisThree centuries after Darth Malak ravaged the world in his flagship trying to kill the Jedi Knight Bastila Shan, this post-apocalyptic world is now an abandoned, swamp. The Republic has sent forces to recolonize the world setting up Spaceports and Military bases. However the Republic's biggest challenge will be to rid the city areas of rakghouls. Once confined to the lower areas of the city they now roam, mutated and bigger than before they are now found over wide areas, infecting those who they come across.Dromund KaasDromund KaasA remote jungle world where the Sith Empire has been building its war machine to wage war across the galaxy. A lost world known only to the Sith, it is home to the Emperor and the largest force of Imperial military.Nar ShaddaaNar ShaddaaThe Smugglers Moon of Nar Shaddaa orbits Hut ta and is known as one of the most vibrant and dangerous places in the galaxy. Everything can be found for the right price, making it the ultimate symbol of corruption.CorelliaCorelliaA founding member of the Galactic Republic, Corellia is one of the most vibrant business centers in the galaxy, and of the highest strategic importance. Besides being the hub for galactic corporate enterprise and maintaining a vocal presence in the Senate, Corellia is also the birthplace of many Republic economic, political, and military leaders. While Coruscant is a symbol of Republic power and tradition, Corellia is a testament to the Republicâs resourcefulness and respect for personal and economic freedom.IlumIlumFound originally by Jedi years ago. The ice world Ilum is covered in the crystals needed to construct lightsabers. Over the years the Order has set up enclaves and temples for the Jedi who make their long pilgrimage to the remote world. It was then used as a rite of passage for new Jedi and a quiet place for Jedi Masters to do intense meditation.Recently, however, the peaceful world was thrown into chaos when the Sith discovered its location. Slaughtering the Jedi on the planet they gained control of the world. With republic forces spread so thin they could not afford to mount a counter-attack. Recent intelligence now reveals that the Sith might be after something much more than the lightsaber crystals as they devote massive resources to the remote world. Republic leaders and the Jedi council now wonder if they lost a far more valuable planet than they once thought.QueshQueshOne of the most toxic planets in the galaxy, but also one of the most valuable. The planet, now controlled by the Republic has chemicals that can produce potent adrenals. Unfortunately Republic scientists were unable to master the process of turning Quesh's chemicals into adrenals so they turned to the Hutts for help getting three Hutt cartels to assist in making the process in exchange for a cut of the profits. Due to this the Sith Empire has tired to take control over the world turning it into a battleground.FlashpointsRattatakiFlashpoints are similar to World of Warcraft's instances where a group of players enters into an instanced-based area to fight against powerful foes.

Not only will these ships be used as a form of transport between planets but will be used as a home base to walk around in, interact with companion characters and players and take into space battles across the galaxy.XS Stock LightSmugglerSuccessor to the Dynamic-class freighter (such as the Ebon Hawk) from the Jedi Civil War era. It has been given an upgrade in size, agility and nearly everything else too, making it one of the fastest ships in the galaxy. Covered in secret compartments the ship is perfect for smuggling contraband or anything else that the captain wants to keep hidden. Armed with a standard laser and torpedo batteries, the ship is designed with two turrets on the utter and lower hulls that can be controlled manually or in the cockpit.FurySith Warrior, Sith InquisitorFeaturing an advanced hyper-drive and powerful sub-light engines the Fury is the most versatile starship in the Imperial fleet. Originally designed for high-priority military missions, it caught the eye of many Sith Lords and has become a favorite for their personal use. Later models of the starship took this into consideration and the interior is now designed for Sith Lords rather than Military personal. Sporting the maneuverability of a smaller fighter and fitted with armaments that rival many larger starships the Fury is a force to be reckoned with.DefenderJedi Knight, Jedi ConsularCreated during the Jedi Civil War the Defender was custom-designed for the Jedi Order. The ship has been built with a two level interior. The top level having aholocom system especially to communivate with the Jedi Counsil, as well as a meeting room and conferance room for planning missions. The lower level includes a medical bay, cargo hold and quarters for the Jedi. While the Jedi are committed to peace the ship is fitted with a powerful shield and twin turbo lasers to deal with enemies.Imperial AgentSo highly advanced that they were impossible to mass produced. The ones that were made are given only to the most trustworthy Imperial Agents. The ship is fitted with some of the best technology and weapons to date and the the hull is designed to be sensor resistant.Space CombatSpace combat in an asteroid field.Space Combat is an optional aspect of The Old Republic. Upon getting a ship, the player will find an intercom offering them various space missions. These missions can be accessed by selecting the location where they take place on the galaxy map (they will appear similarly to planets). These space missions currently take the form of on-rail shooters, although the player is able to fly around the screen. Each mission has unique objectives.Your ship can be also outfitted with special armor, bought from vendors, which upgrade things like armor, shield strength, shield recharge, weapon damage, number of missiles available, and so on. As you level up over time the missions will increase in difficultly and become more complex, requiring more expensive ship upgrades to be reasonably achieved.Space Combat missions are entirely optional. Unlike previous Knights of the Old Republic games, there is no risk of space combat while travelling from planet to planet.Voice ActingAt E3 2009, BioWare announced that Star Wars: The Old Republic would be fully voice acted. In July, BioWare talked to Joystiq about their voice acting techniques and said that the script for the game is the size of over 40 novels and consists of over 100 voice actors that will perform 1,000 4-hour sessions of recording by the game's completion. The game is said to go down in video game history for how much voice acting there is in the game.At Gamescom 2009, it was announced that the game would be fully localized in French and German.GameplayCover SystemTwo classes, the Smuggler and the Imperial Agent, have access to a cover system. While in cover, these classes have access to additional abilities, however they are unable to move. This trade off can be risk in some scenarios, especially PVP or end game operations, however the DPS version of these classes require cover for optimal output. While these characters can take cover using natural terrain, if there is no cover available they will automatically deploy portable shields for the same effect.PVPPlayer Versus Player is a major system in The Old Republic. The first place most players will encounter PVP combat is in one of three designated ""Warzones"" currently in the game. The first, ""Alderaan Civil War"" is a control point based scenario where the two factions compete for control of three turrets which, when captured, will fire at an enemy ship. Each ship starts with 600 ""points"" and the first to diminish the other team's health to zero through capturing and holding three turrets wins. The second, ""Voidstar"" is an attack/defend map, where one faction is set to defend certain doors, and keep the other, offensive team, from planting explosives on them, eventually reaching a computer terminal at the end. The third, ""Huttball"" is similar to american soccer. A ball is placed in the center of the field, and either team tries to get the ball to the opposing goal. The field, however, is treacherous, and players can be killed by it very easily-- Or kill enemies with it. To enter a Warzone, once a player reaches level ten they can click a button on the lower right hand side of their minimap to queue. There is not currently a way to select which Warzone you would like to enter; You must queue randomly for all three.Outside of these warzones, players can choose to participate in PVP combat anywhere, either by selecting a PVP or RP-PVP server when the begin the game, or by flagging themselves for PVP while on a PVE sever. There are also several World PVP zones, including the entire planet of Ilum, which have special objectives. By participating in PVP combat, players earn Valor, a sort of experience which increases ones Valor Rank, unlocking new titles (every tenth rank) or items, and Warzone or Mercenary commendations (depending on where the PVP took place), currencies used to purchase special PVP related items.Bioware has indicated plans for more Warzones to be released via future patches.Crew SkillsCrew Skills is the crafting system in Star Wars: The Old Republic. The crafting is primarily done by the player's companions, with some gathering done by the player. The player can, for a fee, send companions away on missions to bring back materials, or send companions away to craft something. The companions will not fight alongside you while they are deployed on missions.There are four gathering skills, Bioanalysis, Scavenging, Slicing, and Archaeology, and three mission skills, Diplomacy, Treasure Hunting and Underworld Trading. Slicing does not gather materials for crafting skills, instead bringing back money and items.The crafting skills are as follows:Armormech - Designing armor for non-force-user classes.Synthweaving - Designing armor for force-use classes.Armstech - Creating blasters, and such.Artifice - Creating lightsaber crystals, weapon modifications, artifacts, and other item upgrades.Cybertech - Creating armor upgrades, and cybernetic implants.Biochem - Creating Stimpacks and Medkits.Players can ""reverse-engineer"" items which they can create, which will return some of the materials used, and has a chance of teaching the player how to create a superior version of the item.Each companion has special benefits to certain crew skills. Increasing affection with a companion will decrease the amount of time it takes to complete tasks.ExpansionsOn December 18th 2012, Bioware announced ""Rise of the Hutt Cartel"", the first ""digital expansion"" for Star Wars: The Old Republic. It will feature a 5 level increase, to a cap of 55, new story content, and access to the new planet of Makeb, where ""the Galactic Republic and Sith Empire fight for control over a powerful secret.""The story line of the expansion will feature a plan from the Hutt Cartel to overthrow the Galactic Republic and Sith Empire to becoming the galaxy's new superpower. There is currently no word on whether the expansion will feature new class-specific storyline content.The expansion will cost $19.99, or $9.99 for subscribers. In their FAQ on the expansion, Bioware said that there will not be a retail release of the expansion. It is currently labeled as having a tentative ""Spring 2013"" release date. Those who pre-order by January 7th 2013 will receive 5 days of early access to the expansion.Beta sign upsOn September 30 2009 the Beta sign ups of the closed beta for Star Wars The Old Republic started. Within minutes, the website was flooded with so many people vying to apply to the game that the servers couldn't handle the demand and simply stopped working. The site was down most of the day with only sporadic moments where it was usable. To apply, you had to either make an account on their website or use an existing one, agree to a non-disclosure agreement, then fill out a form that consisted of your name, address, country, province, postal code and phone number. After which they would scan your system to see what hardware you had and send it in with the aforementioned data they collected. It is yet unknown when people will be selected to play the beta or when it will actually begin. However, judging from the response by the fan base so far, it doesn't look like they will have a hard time finding people to test their game.When you tried to connect to the website you where greeted with this message:""Thank you for visiting www.StarWarsTheOldRepublic.com. We are making adjustments to the site due to the overwhelming response to the testing announcement. Please be patient and check back later. We estimate that the site will be back up in the next few hours.""Threat of PeaceOn 02/07/2009 BioWare announced that they would be starting a web comic based on the game that would be created by Dark Horse Comics called âStar Wars: The Old Republic - Threat of Peaceâ. It would be released free of charge every other Friday on the starwarstheoldrepublic.comâs website to try and draw fans into the setting and give them a bases for what the games story will encompass. The comic will be written by BioWareâs Rob Chestney with art by Alex Sanchez and it will span three decades beginning from the signing of the Treaty of Coruscant to major events that occur at the beginning of the game. Dark Horse Comicâs have been the company that has been charged with creating all of the comic book based stories set in the Star Wars universe for some time now. Fans have been generally excited about this news as Dark Horse has a proven track record of treating the Star Wars franchise well.The release of the comic however has garnered mixed results with the fan base. Many where turned off by the awkward art style used in the comic while others just fund it competent. The series has also had many problems with the way it has chosen to develop its story and how it chose to introduce the characters. Many people have found it poorly written and awkward to understand what is going on at any one frame as it skips between many different characters and settings, sometimes three or more times on one page. It has lead to many people giving up on reading the comic as they have no idea what is going on or why they should care about the characters that have been introduced as they have no sense of introduction other than to just appear on the page with no back story or place of reference for the readers to work from. It is yet unknown how many installments will be released or if it will end once the game is released but as of now it appears as though it will continue up until the gameâs release date some time in Spring 2011.Friday UpdatesOn 12.19.2008 they announced that every Friday on the swtor.com website they would regularly release new info about the game. So far it has been varied between Class Reveal, Developer Blog, Planet Reveal, Video Jedi Archives (Timeline), Video Documentary, the current webcomic, and Fan Friday.Class Reveal â BioWare announced all of the known classes one at a time over a period of a few months in what they called Class Reveals. The first to be released was the Bounty Hunter, followed by the Trooper and finally The Sith Warrior and Smuggler. The final classes to be reveal were the Sith Inquisitor and the Jedi Consular. They are currently revamping each class page, starting with the Sith Warrior.Developer Blog - The developer blog is as the name implies, a blog postings from the games developers. A selected developer would write up a shot page or two that discusses some aspect of the games production. It has ranged from how they write stories for the game to information about the inspirations for classes and what went into design how they would function in the game.Planet Reveal â BioWare would release information as well as concept art and occasionally screen shots of one of the worlds that will be in the game. So far they have released 13 planets, with the most recent being Hoth.Video Jedi Archives (Timeline)- These have been videoâs narrated by Master Gnost-Dural that describe various points of interest that happen during the game. They have been very well received by the community and are a personal favorite for many. The archives consist of a voice actor playing the part of Master Gnost-Dural who would describe an important event in the games history while various still images depicting the story would appear in the video to compliment the voice over in telling an engaging story.Video Documentary â The Video Documentaries have been a behind the scenes look of what has been going in the making of the game. They have ranged from showing various levels getting created to characters being modeled. As well the video documentary was the first time we had a chance to see any kind of in game footage of it running.Threat of Peace/Blood of the Empire â Both Threat of Peace and Blood of the Empire are webcomics that were developed by Dark Horse comics and were written by BioWare to help compliment the games story. They follow three-hundred years of history leading up to events that take place at the start of the game. They are meant to help inform the player base of what has lead up to the current situation they will be begin in as well as give them an idea of what to expect in the game once it is released. Threat of Peace was the first webcomic series and ended February 26, 2010. Blood of the Empire was started shortly afterward, and is currently being released at a rate of about 1 comic every 2 weeks.Fan Friday- Fan Fridays are recurrent features which showcase various pieces of work by the community, including fan art and fan fiction. Also appearing in Fan Fridays are developer corners, which show a part of the game the developers are working on. Examples include special effects, taxi cabs, character customization, and depth of field. New polls and avatars are often put out with Fan Fridays as well.Limited Collector's EditionWhen announced, Star Wars: The Old Republic Collector's edition quickly went up to the #1 best seller on Amazon (in video games). It sold out quickly, but was later restocked and available for pre-order again. The Collector's edition will cost $149.99 MSRP.

1432570,ç¼çä¼ ï¼Legendary Assassinï¼,0,xing,xing,0,0,0,"Action, Adventure, Free to Play, Massively Multiplayer, RPG, Strategy",Simplified Chinese,,,"OverviewLegendary was a game developed by Spark Unlimited and published by Gamecock Media Group. Legendary was released on November 4th, 2008 (on PS3 and Xbox 360) and November 18th, 2008 (PC). The game includes a single-player campaign and multiplayer.StoryLegendary follows the story of an art thief named Charles Deckard. The game begins in New York's Museum of Modern Art, where Deckard is tricked into opening Pandora's Box during a routine art heist. Once Deckard opens the box, his left hand is burned with a Signet, an insignia of Pandora. In addition to gaining the insignia of Pandora, Deckard also releases mythical creatures upon the earth. Such creatures include: griffons, golems, werewolves, fire drakes, and minotaurs. Along the way, Deckard discovers the Black Order, a group sent to destroy Deckard and contain the monsters released from Pandora's box. Eventually, the player discovers that the Black Order isn't actually trying to contain the mythical monsters, rather, they plan to capture the monsters so they can be used as super soldiers for its developing army.Gameplay  Some FPS action.Aside from the normal conventions seen in standard FPS games, Legendary gives the player the ability to siphon Animus Energy through the Pandora Signet when an enemy is killed. Once siphoned, the souls become energy that can be used to replenish health or to perform a force-push that can knock down impending barricades or stun enemies. Enemies include many different mythical creatures, including: ""normal"" and ""alpha"" werewolves, minotaurs, griffons, golems, a kraken, fire drakes, echidnas, Nari (or Narfi), the God of Chaos Loki, bloodticks, and dragons. Enemy Types Firedrakes:  These fire-breathing, heavily armored lizards can usually be found underground, although some do venture out into the sunlight in search of fresh meat. They can spit large fireballs at foes, so even if you are a good distance away, they can still get you. If you get too near, the drake will send out a fire pulse from its body, pushing you back. Their armor can stand up to large barrages of bullets, so your best bet would probably be either the shotgun or, of all things, the fire ax. Like mythological salamanders, firedrakes spawn in fire pits, so you will want to use water to take those out. In contact with water, even the hardiest firedrake will harden and die.Limos Werewolves:Despite the myths, werewolves are not transformed humans, but a killer canine-ape hybrid. They can't turn you into one of them, so they'll just settle for ripping your head off. Cursed by Limos, the Greek god of hunger, the lesser Limos werewolves have to eat constantly, or risk eating themselves from the inside out. They are extremely agile, so rapid-fire guns are your best bet. Werewolves can regenerate from most damage, meaning you have to decapitate them to prevent them from coming back. If one falls with its head still intact, rush in with the fire axe to stop it from getting back up.Alpha Werewolves:Recognized by their thick coat of fur, Alpha werewolves are much more hardy than their lesser cousins. The same rules apply, but Alphas can take a lot more damage. Occasionally, Alpha werewolves will jump on you and attempt to maul you. Follow the on-screen prompts to save your life and turn the tables, resulting in a one-hit K.O.! Oh, one more thing: Alphas most often attack in packs with their weaker cousins, so stay on your toes.Nari  :These flying imps resemble pixies but are equipped with razor-sharp teeth and talons. Keep on the alert for their trademark laughter, sounding like hundreds of little girls. Nari mainly flitters around in flocks, becoming intangible and invulnerable. When they want to attack you, they turn solid and float in to claw at your face. In those few seconds, use a rapid-fire weapon to shoot them out of the air. Nari are very cunning and very, very dangerous. They can possess inanimate objects and turn them against you, leading to all kinds of mischief and slaughter.Minotaurs:These towering bull-men are not to be taken lightly. They are immensely strong, fast, and carry huge clubs. They are nearly bullet-proof from the front, so your only chance is to evade them and blast away at their back with heavy-duty weapons like the shotgun. Even then, it still takes a lot to bring them down. Good luck fighting more than one at the same time...Griffons:You will want to avoid these as much as possible. These flying predators are as large as buses and more powerful than minotaurs. Fortunately, griffons tend to keep away from you, flying around in the sky (and taking down your air support). However, on occasion, one will swoop in close enough to decide that you look tasty, at which point you have no choice but to do battle. Keep as far away from the slashing beak as possible, and proceed to fill it with as many kinds of lead as you can find. It's an entirely different story when you have the rocket launcher, however. One well placed rocket should ensure that the bird never flies again.Echidnas:No, these are not the spiky monotremes from Australia. They're not the lost members of Knuckle's race either. These tentacled monsters are based off of the deadly serpent-woman from Greek mythology, and are every bit as slimy and bloodthirsty as their mother. You never get to see the full monster, but the tentacles will eagerly snatch passerby and pull them to a grisly death. If you should find yourself in an echidna's grasp, quickly blast it with your gun to make it release you. Since these creatures actually grab you, you will want to avoid using fire to attack them. Although echidnas never venture out of water, staying dry doesn't always mean you are safe...Tsuchigumo's Children:In Japanese mythology, the ancient spider-demon Tsuchigumo was killed by the hero Raiko. From the demon's corpse, however, thousands of red spiders poured out into the world. Nicknamed ""Blood Spiders"", these little devils come in colonies produced by a vile-looking queen. The queen will constantly pump out spiders, which will make a beeline (spiderline?) straight for you, exploding when they reach you. The only way to stop the swarm is to take out the queen. Even then, the queen will release the rest of her offspring upon her death, so don't let up until there's not an insect in sight.Golem: In Jewish folklore, golems are hulking brutes made from clay, used as household servants. This golem, on the other hand, is made from building rubble and smashed cars, and is getting his ""Godzilla"" on in Times Square. Bullets and even missiles are a joke against this fella, since he ismade out of BUILDINGS. However, the only thing keeping the colossus together is a magnetic field sucking in debris. Your one chance on stopping this guy is to use E.M.P. devices to knock out the field, and even that is FAR from easy.Kraken:While the situation on land is bad, it's even worse in the oceans. Pandora's Box has awoken nameless leviathans from their ancient slumber. One of the worst is the Scandinavian sea monster, the Kraken. Big Boy here decides to get in on the action too, heading to London. Soon enough, the Kraken hauls itself out of the Thames and rips down Big Ben! Like the golem, the kraken requires heavy-duty weapons to take down, the difference being that the kraken is still flesh and blood. Use the rocket launcher to shoot its tentacles. When the kraken roars in pain, shoot another rocket down the sea monster's throat. Easy? You wish.  MultiplayerLegendary has an online multiplayer component.  Critical ReceptionLegendary received mostly negative reviews, including a 2.5 (Xbox version) and a 2.3 (PS3) from IGN, although OXM and Gameplanet each gave it a 7.5.",,,,,,,,,

The three demons being Griffon, a bird which fights with long-range electric attacks, Shadow, a cat that fights by manipulating its body into spikes and V's devil trigger summon, Nightmare, a lumbering demon that matches a lot of DMC5's bosses in size.(See Also - Devil May Cry 1 bosses Griffon & Nightmare.)Trish - Character model based on model Ariana Diamant - Mocapped & voice acted by Wendee Lee. Trish returns with the Sparda sword in hand continuing her role of assisting Dante.Lady - Character model based on model Andrea Tivadar - Mocapped & voice acted by Kate Higgins. Demon hunter Lady also returns with her signature Kalina Ann rocket launcher to team up with Dante & Trish on another big job.Nico - New character Nico is the granddaughter of Nell Goldstein, the gunsmith who created Dante's guns Ebony & Ivory. Nico has dreams of being a legendary craftswoman & weapons maker like her grandmother & his formed a partnership with Nero, making & selling her Devil Breaker arms to him. She drives her van to Nero's locations during missions, functioning as a mobile base of operations.StoryAlong with the Devil Breaker System featuring a range of bionic arms, Nero returns with his sword ""Red Queen"" and his revolver ""Blue Rose"". The game's story is the furthest in the DMC timeline, chronologically following the 3rd, 1st, 2nd and 4th game.Nero now runs as a separate branch of Devil May Cry, a demon-hunting business with Dante. One day, a mysterious enemy appears and literally rips off Nero's Devil Bringer arm from his body, taking the power of Yamato with it. One month later, demons invade Red Grave City, with a giant Qliphoth tree taking root there and draining the blood of most citizens nearby. Dante and the rest of Devil May Cry try to slay the demon at the top of the tree, Urizen, but they find his power too strong as Dante, Lady, and Trish all lie unconscious while the newcomer V drags Nero away from the scene.One month after Dante's defeat, Nero, V, and Nero's friend Nico head back to Red Grave City to destroy the Qliphoth and Urizen, and rescue their friends if they are still alive. Nico uses her weaponsmith skills to design temporary bionic replacements for Nero's severed arm, known as Devil Breakers, that give Nero a fighting chance against these new demons.DevelopmentWith full development following 2015's Devil May Cry 4: Special Edition, DMC5 was announced at E3 2018 at Microsoft's Press Conference. It marks a return to the original Devil May Cry universe which last had a full instalment in 2008 with Devil May Cry 4. This game marks the return of Hideaki Itsuno as the director, who also led Devil May Cry 2, Devil May Cry 3 and 4 along with their upgraded versions. It is reported that many staff members from prior Itsuno-directed projects are returning.The game has been confirmed to be running on the Capcom's RE Engine as the 2019 Resident Evil 2 remake and 2017's Resident Evil 7 rather than Capcom's MT Framework which was used for DMC4, Dragon's Dogma (also directed by Itsuno) and 2018's Monster Hunter: World. This came with a focus on photo-realism but the game aims to maintain the smooth 60 frames-per-second that the series is known for.",,,,,,,,,

At the top of the tower, the dark lord Drokmar possesses the Black Orb. The goal is to traverse the tower and stop Drokmar's plan to rule the world with the power of the magic crystal. There are two endings to the game - the ending depends on whether the player embraces or destroys the Black Orb.GameplayThe game is primarily a hack and slash sidescroller but also includes platforming in the form of parallel paths of travel and avoiding ground hazards. As the player progresses, they'll encounter new swords that cause increased damage and have different magic attacks. Most swords are acquired immediately after a boss battle at the end of certain levels. Chests and doors can be opened to reveal items and allies respectively. However, some chests and doors are traps that release enemies or other hazards. Doors also require keys to open, which are collected and stored by the player. Only one ally can travel with the player character at a time, and has its own health and level associated with it. Allies level up with items or by passing over the same type of ally again. The game also features a level select option, allowing the player to skip to level 5, 9, 13, 22, 26, 30, or 33.SecretsMost levels have at least one hidden chest. A secret chest is invisible unless the player character has the Thief ally, crystal ball item, or they strike it with their sword to open it. Some levels have secret doors that warp the player one or more floors ahead when used. These doors can never be seen until activated.Version DifferencesThe SNES version of the game removed some enemies from the game and moves one of the bosses to a different floor.

1432720,Ardein.Arise Demo,0,Alex Grade,Alex Grade,0,0,0,,English,,,"OverviewBandai Namco's latest Tales of... game was announced at E3 2019 during the Microsoft press conference, and was released worldwide on most platforms on September 9, 2021 (with a Steam release one day later). The latest Tales title has multiple changes from previous games in the franchise, including a new engine using Unreal Engine 4 as the base, different art style, and updated gameplay mechanics.PlotThe planet of Rena has ruled over the world of Dahna for 300 years, taking its resources and enslaving its people by dividing Dahna's territory with walls and appointing five Lords to rule over its people. Most Dahnans have been so beaten down they revere Dahna and hope to one day join it, but a select few seek to rebel against their oppressors and free Rena from Dahna's grasp.In this setting, a Dahnan man in an iron mask without his memories who can't feel pain rescues a Renan woman with a curse that brings pain to everyone who touches her. The two soon join forces, hoping to defeat all five Lords and overthrow their Renan oppressors.Main CharactersAlphenVA: Takuya Sato (JP) | Ray Chase (EN)A Dahnan slave who lost his memories and his ability to feel pain, initially named ""Iron Mask"" for the iron mask that he wears and is unable to take off. With Shionne's help, he is able to wield a Blazing Sword that would normally kill most people, and slowly regains memories of his past life as Alphen, going on a journey with her to destroy the Renan Lords and free all Dahnans from their oppressors. He also enjoys cooking food with lots of spices that are too much for most people to handle.ShionneVA: Shino Shimoji (JP) | Erica Lindbeck (EN)A Renan woman who delivers a painful ""Curse of Thorns"" to anyone who touches her. She teams up with Alphen after he is the only one to not recoil in pain from her curse, and is on a mission to defeat the five Renan Lords. She wields a magical rifle and grenades in combat, and enjoys eating a wide variety of food.RinwellVA: Sayuri Hara (JP) | Christine Marie Cabanos (EN)A Dahnan Mage who is somehow able to use Astral Artes that were thought to only be usable by Renans, by chanting incantations with her books. She risks her life to get help for the Dahnan resistance in Cyslodia. Rinwell travels with a small owl named Hootle.LawVA: Yoshitsugu Matsuoka (JP) | Bryce Papenbrook (EN)A Dahnan man who works for Rena's Bureau of Observation, a secret police organization in Cyslodia tasked with hunting down Dahnan dissidents. He initially tries to arrest Alphen, but later joins him on his quest after seeing his father murdered by the Renan Lord he served. A skilled martial artist who prefers solving problems with his fists rather than his head, he can shatter rocks and armor with his fists alone.KisaraVA: Haruna Ikezawa (JP) | Katelyn Gault (EN)The strongest Dahnan soldier who serves directly under Dohalim in Elde Menancia. After seeing her brother sacrifice himself for Dohalim's ideals, she decided to join him and Alphen on their quest. Kisara dresses in a full suit of armor, wielding a tower shield and mace, and will block enemy attacks while the others dodge. She can also use her shield to stop enemies from charging and instantly down them for a few seconds.Dohalim il QarasVA: Yasuyuki Kase (JP) | Griffin Puatu (EN)The mild-mannered Renan Lord of Elde Menancia who transformed his domain into a peaceful land for Dahnans and Renans alike. He is well-versed in various forms of art. After surviving a coup attempt and admitting that his motives were not so noble, Dohalim abdicates his seat of power to travel with the others, hoping to spread his ideals to the rest of the world. Dohalim wields a staff in combat, and can use earth-based Astral Artes.GameplayArise retains some similarities to previous mainline title Tales of Berseria in having a party of up to six characters where four can battle at any one time, the two reserves can be swapped in as needed, and fighting is done on a fully 3D plane instead of a largely 2D plane with sprites. Beasts are no longer randomly encountered on the world map, but monsters with their own attitudes who can be fought or avoided as needed. Unlike other games, enemies will no longer drop gald by themselves, though some may drop items that can be sold.Combat is slightly different, keeping the use of AG diamonds to pull off various Artes in lieu of a mana point system, but all healing-type Artes pull from a shared pool of Cure Points (CP) that does not regenerate on its own, and can only be restored with specific Gels or resting at a campsite or inn. CP can also be used by characters outside of battle to accomplish extra tasks, like removing a wall of flame or healing an NPC.Characters can also make food in the field based on recipes gained through sidequests or hidden chests to heal their party and provide a stat buff, but must rest at campsites or inns to do so, similar to Final Fantasy XV, rather than cook food whenever they wish (if they have the ingredients).Saving and fast travel are no longer done at specific points on the map. Saving can be done anywhere manually, on top of two auto-save slots that are frequently overwritten. Fast travel can be done at almost any time once the player stumbles over a fast travel point on a map, except when the game story locks the function.",,,,,,,,,

1431650,The Wonderful 101: Remastered Wonder-Size Cadet Demo,0,PlatinumGames Inc.,PlatinumGames Inc.,0,0,10,,"English, French, Italian, German, Spanish - Spain, Japanese",,,"OverviewThe Wonderful 101 is an action game directed by Hideki Kamiya for PlatinumGames and originally published by Nintendo. In it, the player controls a group of heroes trying to protect the Earth from an alien invasion by transforming into a wide range of weapons and objects including a giant fist or bridge. Players have to employ different strategies for a successful approach to taking out the invaders.GameplayThe player controls a group of heroes that can attack enemies or 'Unite' into larger objects with their own unique uses and advantages including a sword, gun and hang glider. For defense, the player's team can form into Unite Guts to block attacks or Unite Dodge to quickly move out of harms way or re-position behind an enemy. Rescuing any of the civilians scattered across the maps increases the size of the player's team, which in turn has an effect on the overall power of attacks.Because of its group-based nature, the game is played from a top-down, three-quarters perspective with the camera pulled out for scale. At its distance, it's possible to control even large groups of heroes but individual character models are displayed small in relation.Unite TeamUnite Team moves are special formations and moves created by forming the heroes into specific shapes through two possible methods; by either drawing a shape directly onto the Wii U GamePad touchscreen or through the use of the right thumbstick. This mechanic is conceptually similar to the celestial brush in Okami.By combining the heroes into a single larger object, the team can create weapons to be used in combat or context-specific support equipment such as hang gliders, bridges and ladders. Using these Unite Team special attacks expends energy from a battery meter, but they can be recharged with basic Unite Attacks. The meter can be lengthened one battery at a time by collecting batteries found throughout the world.For greater strategic depth, it is possible to use more than one Unite formation at once. For example, shapes for both the Unite Hand and Unite Sword can be used in succession to divide the player's team into both and have them fight simultaneously.Wii U TouchscreenWhile much of the Wii U's touchscreen functionality allows the player to draw shapes to quickly access Unite Team weapons, there are moments where the display is used for other purposes. When inside buildings, for example, the touchscreen displays the building's interior, while the building exterior is displayed on the television. This allows for puzzles such as a combination lock in which the numerical displays are only visible outside the building (on the TV), but the dials to change the combination and the combination itself are located inside, on the touchscreen.MultiplayerThe game features a local-only competitive co-op mode for up to five players with support for the Wii U Pro Controller or Wii Classic Controller Pro. Players have to work together to defeat enemies but are ultimately competing for high scores against each other. If one player dies, everyone has to start over.AestheticWhere The Wonderful 101's core gameplay necessitates a large sense of scale, it also creates a specific aesthetic. The perspective evokes the idea of playing with action figures. As enemies are destroyed, they break apart and reveal metal frames and toy-like parts. With character designs similar to the ones found in Viewtiful Joe, the game has a look reminiscent of Japanese tokusatsu in the vein of Super Sentai and Kamen Rider.OriginsAccording to Hideki Kamiya at PAX Prime 2013, the game that became The Wonderful 101 began life as a title that was to feature an all-star roster of Nintendo characters. This game featured similar gameplay concepts in the unite morphs. However, the pitch to Nintendo was rejected when part of the pitch involved an image of Princess Peach, Luigi, and Yoshi being used as a bridge by Mario; a concept that those involved at Nintendo did not approve of. The idea was subsequently reworked, replacing the Nintendo characters with the new hero characters found in the final game.Kickstarter CampaignOn February 3rd 2020 Platinum games launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund and self-publish a Nintendo Switch port of the game. The campaign's initial goal of 50,000 USD was met within 30 minutes of the campaign launching. Stretch goals for Steam and PS4 versions were also met within hours.",,,,,,,,,

The core of the game is to spend Festival Points (FP) to play volleyball matches in order to win items and points. FP recharge over time but can also be fully restored with an item the player can win in game or with DMM's paid currency, but they are also restored when the player level up their account.The website DualShockers.com composed this handy guide to installing the game.The most prominent departure from the previous titles is that the volleyball, always a major component of the franchise, has been stripped of a major feature: the player can no longer actually PLAY the volleyball. Xtreme 3 included what was called ""Owner mode"" which put the player in the place of managing a duo of characters, and that's all the player does in Venus Vacation.This team management is the entirety of the gameplay in this game. Apart from watching volleyball and giving the team some very simple instructions there isn't much to do. The player can manage their gear, feed swimsuits to other swimsuits to raise their level, buy spins of the ""gacha"" roulette wheel, and take pictures of the ladies.As the player level up their account and characters visual novel style cutscenes will unlock.

1430280,Angry Emoji The Game,599,TrilliGames,TrilliGames,0,0,0,"Action, Casual, Indie, Early Access",English,,,"Emoji PopEmoji Pop is a Bubble-Shooter puzzle game for the web. The core gameplay similar to other mobile puzzle games like Bubble Witch Saga 3 and Panda Pop, in which players shoot colored bubbles to make matches.Players can also choose to swap which Emoji to shoot, adding a layer of strategy to the game. Players also unlock special Emoji Obstacles which don't behave like ordinary colored Emojis. These introduce new non-standard mechanics to the game, increasing in complexity as the player progresses. The first Emoji Obstacle is the Soap Emoji, which pops as a cluster regardless of which colored Emoji the player shoots at it.The game is currently in live development on the web at https://playemojipop.com, and is playable from all web-enabled smartphones and laptops.Creative ModeEmoji Pop's most unique feature is its Creative Mode, which empowers players to design their own levels using the Emojis they've unlocked by beating levels in the game. Players can then share their level's web-link on social media for anyone to play instantly. Then, anyone in the world can play that level from any web-enabled device, without even needing to create an account.The solo-developer of the game, Dylan Woodbury, teaches players practical design skills through a series of video tutorials surfaced to the player in-game. Players are encouraged to join the Emoji Pop community, playtest user-made levels, and give each other feedback. The best levels and their creators are featured in the game's side-modes, in which players can beat user-made levels to win bonus moves for the main campaign mode.ProgressionMost free-to-play puzzle games feature a ""saga-map"" progression system that requires players beat levels one-by-one, often resulting in players getting stuck on a level for a long period of time. Emoji Pop features a progression system based on the idea of continuous levels, in which moves regenerate after the player runs out. Players can hit Star Emojis to unlock mini-levels, which give them a limited number of tries to win major rewards, or else the level disappears.By winning consecutive mini-levels, players go on a ""streak"", which means they get more attempts to beat the next mini-level. They also get an upgraded ""slot machine"", which will potentially reward them with more bonus moves after winning a mini-level.By beating the longer continuous levels, players unlock new Emoji Obstacles which introduce increasingly complex mechanics to the game. Early examples include a Lightbulb Emoji which changes colors each turn, and a Snail Emoji which moves across the board. Because players aren't required to beat every level in the game, the developers can introduce skill-based mechanics far more complex than ever attempted in a Bubble Shooter before. An early example of this is the Dagger Emoji, which spins around and requires players time their shot accordingly in order to launch the Dagger in the most optimal direction. The developer plans on adding more Emoji Obstacles that are based in timing, physics, and logic.",,,,,,,,,

1430640,Into The Haze,1499,MSOFT,MSOFT,0,0,0,"Action, Adventure, Indie, Early Access","English, Thai",,,"OverviewHaze is a first-person shooter from Free Radical Design (the now defunct studio who renamed to Crytek UK), the development studio responsible for the TimeSplitters series. Rather than sticking with the developer's multiplayer-heavy roots, Haze is more of a story-driven, single-player-focused game. The game does have a multiplayer mode though, as well as a four-player co-op option for the story. The game was published by Ubisoft in all territories. When it was first announced, it was supposed to be on the Xbox 360 and PC as well as the PlayStation 3, but at some point in the game's development, it went PS3 only.Prior to game's release, Haze made an affiliation with Korn. This spawned a popular internet meme from the reactions of the cast of the HotSpot podcast to Johnathan Davis' agent's quote on the game which is: ""Gaming for me is a religion, and Haze is the shit! I had to come up with a track that can hit up that kind of rush I get from the game, and I think we really rocked it!!""StoryPlayers take on the role of Shane Carpenter, a newly-enlisted soldier with the Mantel Corporation, who is entering into a foreign country, ostensibly to fight a dictator that they have nicknamed ""Skin Coat,"" due to reports of natives being skinned and eaten alive. Soldiers working for Mantel are suited up in intelligent armor that monitors health and delivers a steady supply of a drug known as Nectar. Nectar can also be manually administered, giving players extra speed, more health, and greater accuracy while active. Nectar withdrawals, however, are a nasty thing, and after a couple of brief missions, you're shown exactly what Nectar is doing to the soldiers.It is no surprise that Carpenter switches sides over the course of the game. Bizarrely though this also cannot be considered to be a spoiler either as publisher Ubisoft went as far as to reveal that this occurs on the back of the game's packaging and during its marketing campaign for the game despite the fact that this is treated as a major narrative plot twist within the game, which in turn confuses many players who are aware of this information.GameplayBesides the single-player campaign, Haze has four-player co-op throughout the story and a 16-player multiplayer component with three basic modes. The rebel and Mantel units again collide here, with the Mantel troops having the ability to use Nectar and the rebel troops using the ability to play dead, which makes them disappear to the eyes of their Nectar-addled opponents.WeaponryIn Haze you acquire many new weapons designed either for Mantel or The Promise Hand.Mantel WeaponsThe âDiplomatâ- Wilson D6 PistolThe âDiplomatâ is the side-arm of choice for the smart Mantel trooper. Itâs got the kind of stopping power that makes the bad guys feel like they were hit by a steam train full of anvils. Itâs especially good at close range âwhen negotiations failâ â hence itâs nickname.The âBlackSawâ - BSW-72 Assault RifleThe âBlackSawâ is the standard issue rifle, but there ainât nothing standard about it. This baby fires rounds made from depleted uranium, meaning that not only do you kill your opponent, you give them radiation poisoning too. Yee-ha!The âBlackSawâ (Suppressed) - BSW-72(S) Assault RifleThis sleek silenced version of the standard issue BlackSaw marginally reduces bullet velocity and rate of fire in exchange for near-silent firing. The perfect tool in covert operations.The âDonkey Puncherâ - DP-118 Combat ShotgunAs painful as it sounds, this high-end shotgun is more than enough to kick any ass presented to you. At close range, itâs a one shot kill affair.The âHard Candyâ HK-387L Rocket LauncherThe Hard Candy is a state of the art rocket launcher, capable of blowing the living shit out of any armored target. Of course, itâs even more fun to try on an unarmored target. I hope you like Sloppy Joes!The âPinpointerâ - BSW-72 ESR Enhanced SniperThis classic sniper rifle couples the ultimate in armor-piercing rounds with a projectile velocity powerful enough to rip right through the sternum of any Promise Hand soldier. Tasty.âSpring Cleanerâ SK3 Fragmentation GrenadesDespite their sweety-pie nickname, these grenades are as tough as they come. Based on the classic dead manâs switch design, these time-operated babies are perfect for crowd clearance.Promise Hand WeaponsThe âRazor TongueâThis classic hunting knife can be used to slash or throw. The rebels can even smear the blade in Nectar by selecting it before making a Nectar Grenade. With Nectar on the blade, the Razor Tongue will cause any Mantel trooper to Overdose.The âLoboâ (Wolf)The Lobo is the standard rifle for most militia groups across the world, and with good cause. With a quick-load double-ended magazine and a large clip size, itâs the ideal weapon for both attack and suppression.The âOsoâ (Bear)This shotgun may be a little rough round the edges, but it still packs a punch. With a slightly larger clips size than its mantel counterpart, the Osoâs extra cartridges can make all the difference in a close-quarters firefight.The âMano del Diosâ (Hand of God)A massive bullet capacity and a surprisingly light weight makes this minigun the stuff of nightmares for anyone up against it. Not to be messed with.The âDragÃ³n de la Genteâ (The Peopleâs Dragon)A practical, portable flamethrower with a comparatively long reach, a few sweeps with this fiery weapon can be enough to clear a room in a matter of seconds.The âAguilaâ (Eagle)This sniper rifle carries fewer rounds than the Mantel equivalent, but what it lacks in number it makes up for in power. A deadly piece of hardware.âMalaFrutaâ (BadFruit)Old school, but that doesnât mean they donât hurt. Filled with a combination of steel chippings and high explosives, these grenades are just as dangerous as Mantelâs own.âNectar GrenadesâMade on-the-fly by strapping a Nectar Administrator onto a standard grenade, this explosive spreads a thick cloud of yellow Nectar gas across the area. Any Mantel soldier stuck in the cloud will Overdose.VehiclesThroughout Haze, you are able to drive/pilot many different vehicles.Mantel VehiclesThe âBoxcartâFast, maneuverable and all-terrain: a combination that has made the âBoxcartâ invaluable to Mantel troops in the difficult jungle landscape. Its lightweight frame is thanks to a notable absence of armor. So, whilst it can transport quickly, in combat it certainly canât guarantee a safe arrival â hence its fragile namesake. Still, the fixed JM90 Heavy Gun turret is a good reason to get out of its way.The âBigBoy'At a mere 35 Tonnes, the âBigBoyâ tank is light in comparison to its ancestors even when fully loaded. This new low-weight version allows for fast-response tactical deployment and a reliably swift track speed. Its primary weapon - an electromagnetic coil cannon - functions like a rail gun, using magnetic forces along the barrel to propel its shells at a dangerously high velocity.âMrs. MantelâEarning its alias by carrying soldiers in its ample belly and âbirthingâ them on the battlefield, this dropship uses a combination of movable rotary engines and miniature kerosene afterburners, making it a true vertical take-off and landing craft. This motion arrangement gives the craft the means to both fly at high-speeds like a jet, but also to maneuver like a helicopter when at low speeds â thus, it is the perfect machine for rapid combat insertions.Promise Hand VehiclesThe âMachoâ (Stag)Like most rebel equipment, the âStagâ is cleverly salvaged, constructed and repaired on-the-fly â resulting in a patchwork appearance. Subsequently, it is well modified for the harsh jungle environment.The âMulaâ (Mule)The âMuleâ is nothing if not ideal for jungle warfare â able to go where bulkier Mantel vehicles cannot reach, it is fast and versatile. The driver is virtually guaranteed a bumpy ride (hence its alias), but with the room for an additional passenger to fire in their defence, this vehicle is perfect for two-man smash ânâ grab missions.The âPalo Huecoâ (The Hollow Bat)This helicopter has a small advantage in manoeuvrability over Mantelâs âMamaâ, thanks to its marginally smaller size and weight. Naturally, its armor is a pale comparison to its Mantel counterpart, but its mounted miniguns ensure it is deadly to ground forces.The âDiente de la Serpienteâ (The Serpentâs Tooth)This mobile missile launcher carries a rare second-generation nuclear missile, modified for a direct attack on the Mantel âLand Carrierâ. The launcher itself is over 26 meters long, and is driven by two 1,800hp diesel engines with a maximum speed of just 20mph.Poor Sales and ReceptionUpon release, Haze received mostly mediocre to low review scores. A notable exception to this was Famitsu which gave the game a rating of 34 out of 40. The game was criticized for a poor story, annoying exposition methods and characters, unimpressive graphics, a low number of multiplayer modes, and AI that was prone to glitching out in both the campaign and deathmatch games- and was still terrible when it wasn't. Some elements received a more neutral response, such as the feel of some of the game's weapons and some elements of the multiplayer.Haze was one of the few third-party exclusive titles released on the Playstation 3 in 2008. Its sales did not meet expectations, selling less than 500,000 copies that year. This is widely considered to be a major factor in the closure of Free Radical, which took place on December 18, 2008.",,,,,,,,,

1429890,Singularity,0,"Jingjing Shen, Cody Wren, David Tree",Screen South,0,0,0,"Casual, Simulation",English,,,"OverviewSingularity is a first-person shooter developed by Raven Software, creators of Marvel Ultimate Alliance and co-creators of Quake 4, which is also published by Activison. The game takes place during both the past and present, hurling you back and forth between the 1950's and present day, with the main story being focused on the Cold War and some of the secrets that the Soviet Union had been hiding from the rest of the world. The biggest secret of all turns out to be time manipulation, the game's selling point, which was discovered on the remote Soviet island of Katorga-12. The game has many aspects of a first person shooter, including puzzles that you must use your abilities to solve, and aging and renewing items either organic or non-organic, while also bringing in ""old-school"" shooter elements such as non-regenerating health and med kits that the player has to pick up throughout the levels.StoryBackstoryIn the year 1950, the leader of the Soviet Union, Josef Stalin, is looking for a weapon to give him a military edge over the United States. Stalin finds what he hopes is that weapon, a mysterious new material named Element 99, found on a mysterious island named Katorga-12. Element 99 could produce an unprecedented amount of energy. The new element possessed a grave risk of contamination, but Stalin was willing to take those risks. Stalin orders that investigations and tests be conducted on the new power source. One of the scientists charged with investigating the element was a man named Barisov. On September 21, 1950, Barisov abandoned all safety protocols andactivated an Element 99 device which lead to some sort of catastrophic event that consumed the entire island. Information about the island is ordered to be buried and erased from memory by the Soviet leaders.The island was all but lost for 50 years until 2010 when an American satellite scans and discovers massive radiation spikes originating from the island. With nothing but a suspicion and radiation readings Titan One sends Captains Devlin and Renko to the island on a reconnaissance mission. Flying into restricted airspace the recon chopper is hit by an E.M.P flinging Devlin into the ocean and crashing Captain Renko on the abandoned dock of Katorga-12PlotAt the beginning of the story in Singularity, the player finds himself in the shoes of Nathaniel Renko, a U.S. black ops soldier who has been sent with his partner James Devlin to investigate the mysterious Katorga-12. The CIA have recently found strange signals coming from it. As the chopper circles the island, it crashes on the edge of the island after a mysterious release of energy. After Renko recovers from the crash, he quickly proceeds to regroup with Devlin in a nearby abandoned school.However, as he travels through the island, Renko suddenly gets caught in a time paradox that sends him to a burning building on Katorga in the 1950s as a mysterious catastrophe shakes the island. As Renko proceeds through the building, he finds a man hanging on the brink of death in the fire, and quickly proceeds to rescue him. When Renko returns to the present, he realizes that something has changed, since the island becomes filled with statues and iconography of the man he rescued.After reuniting with Devlin, Renko is ambushed by a huge force of modern Russian spetsnaz. With fire being opened upon them, Renko and Devlin try to escape, but nonetheless get captured and are confronted by a mysterious Russian general. After a short meeting with him, Devlin winds up dead, since the general personally shoots him, and Renko gets rescued by a woman named Kathryn Norvikova.Katheryn sheds some light on what's going on, saying she works for a group named Mir 12, and explains to Renko that Russia gained a colossal military superiority over everyone else in the Cold War after discovering the mysterious mineral E99 on Katorga. Using E99 powered weapons on the battlefield, the Soviet Union quickly took over the world, led by Doctor Demichev, a key figure who operated on Katorga 12 in the 50s. Katherine informs you that he was helped by Doctor Barisov, a man with good intents who was the only one capable of stopping Demichev, but was shot by the latter during the fall of Katorga. In order to save Barisov from his death in the past, Katherine sends you to find the TMD, or the Time Manipulation Device, which is capable of rewinding time and is possibly the most fierce weapon ever invented.Upon finding the TMD, Renko quickly proceeds to meet up with Barisov in the 50s, and rescue him from his death by Demichev's hands. Upon meeting Demichev, Renko recognizes that Demichev looks vaguely like the man he rescued in the burning building, but pays little attention to that fact. After rescuing Doctor Barisov, Renko then travels backwards and forwards through time under Barisov's and Katherine's instructions. Although Renko continues discovering more and more grizzly details of the catastrophe that took place on Katorga, his main objective is to find and arm the E99 bomb, a weapon of mass destruction that Barisov believes will wipe Katorga from existence before the utilization of E99 for Demichev's needs to take over the world.After spending most of the game preparing the bomb, Renko then places it in the center of Katorga in the building that is producing the Singularity, the disruption of time that is responsible for all the anomalies on the island, as well as the catastrophe that took place in the 50s. However, upon placing the bomb, Renko finds that it simply disappears without causing any damage, at which point Demichev finally catches up to you and attempts to kill you and Barisov. He tells you that no matter how many times Renko and Barisov attempted to stop the Singularity, they failed every time, since Demichev has been rescued by Renko from death in a burning building in one of the time lines, allowing him to continue keeping the Singularity alive.EndingsAs a result, in the end, Renko has the choice to kill Demichev, travel back in time to the flaming building, and kill his other self that is rescuing Demichev in order to ensure the Singularity never happens. If the player chooses that course of action, he finds himself living in an idealistic Soviet society that still has taken over the world, but is instead led by the noble ideas of Doctor Barisov.Another option is to shoot Barisov, and then be bestowed all the gifts promised to you by Demichev as a reward. This ending shows Renko leading Demichev's fearless troops across the world, with the TMD in your hand making you the most powerful soldier on the battlefield. However, as you continue getting power, a chasm develops between you and Demichev, and by the end, two Soviet factions appear on the verge on conflict: one in the United States led by Demichev, and another in Russia led by Renko. As a result, the world finds itself on the brink of another Cold War.In the final ending option, you can kill both men, and leave, mysteriously disappearing. The deaths of both potential leaders for the Soviet empire cause it to collapse into hundreds of warring states, leading the world into anarchy as chaos ensues worldwide. The ending concludes with an implication that someone is trying to restore the American White House, and potentially trying to re-create the country.GameplaySingularity is a linear first person shooter that has players traversing through a destroyed Katorga-12 in the year 2010, periodically traveling through time to a 1950s state of the island, specifically when everything began to fall apart. Players do battle against Soviet troops from the present and past as well as mutated creatures, the aftermath of the cataclysmic event. A variety of weapons are available, from the standard assault rifle and shotgun to more unique weaponry such as the Seeker, a semi automatic rifle that allows the player to guide each bullet to a target. Throughout the game the player can upgrade their weapons and TMD device.The collapse of the Katorga-12 operation in the 1950s has led to random time warps and rifts that occur throughout the island. With these, the player will be forced into or voluntarily enter the 1950s and back respectively. After acquiring the hand-mounted TMD device, the player can manipulate objects, the environment, and enemies by aging or reverting them. For example, a broken staircase can be mended by warping it back to its 1950s state, enemies can be killed by aging them into dust, and more.Similar to Bioshock, the player can learn more about what happened to Katorga-12 by listening to audio logs left behind by its inhabitants and researchers. However, these audio logs cannot be picked up, so the player must stand near them to hear it.WeaponsMain WeaponsCenturionSix round revolver that does small damage despite shooting E99 slugs. To get the 20 kills achievement, it is recommended to rack up as many of them at the beginning on easy when fighting the mutants. Upgrading it is generally inadvisable, since there are far more powerful weapons that are worth upgrading.AR9 ValkyrieThe standard assault rifle found on Katorga 12, and carried by most of the enemy forces you encounter. Fits 30 bullets per magazine and has a useful red-dot sight. Generally recommended to upgrade, seeing as to it is easy to scavenge ammo for it, and it becomes absolutely deadly in the later stages of the game.Volk S4Automatic shotgun that is deadly on close ranges. While it is generally less useful against soldiers (since you have to come up to them before shooting), it is deadly against most of the mutants, who usually close in for a close combat attack. Since it brings down even the toughest enemies (excluding bosses) in 2-3 shots, it is generally inadvisable to upgrade it. Becomes even more useless after acquiring the autocannon.Kasimov SNV-E99AutocannonThe main sniper rifle in the game that is also capable of slowing down time. It can be noted that the rifle does more damage when time is slowed down. Generally, while the sniper rifle is not particularly useful in most shootouts, it is worth considering upgrading because of the high amounts of damage it causes, which can be useful against the more powerful enemies.AutocannonIf bluntly described, it is in essence a minigun. Found towards the middle of the game, it is advised to exploit it as much as possible for the rest of the trip, since it is similar in behavior to the Valkyrie, but has a much larger magazine and does far more damage upon upgrade. Highly advised to prioritize when distributing tech points.SpikeshotDethex LauncherGenerally, very powerful railgun that deals large amounts of damage. Particularly useful, since it highlights the heat signatures of all enemies in dark areas, but has a large disadvantage in the fact that ittakes a small amount of time to charge upon before shooting. Generally, similarly to the Kasimov, it is not generally advised to upgrade the Spikshot before some other guns, seeing as to the fact that is has a very specific use. However, the one hit kill for most enemies could be a strong bargain.Dethex LauncherSpecial purpose explosive/grenade launcher. It can either act as a typical grenade launcher with a large magazine, it also deploys a bomb that could be controlled manually. Generally inadvisable to upgrade, since it is very hard to find ammo for it, and because the special guided bomb ability is rarely used due to intensity of the combat.Special WeaponsSeekerA highly powerful gun that shoots one bullet at a time, but it is a one hit kill for all enemies other than bosses. Due to the fact that the bullet is explosive, it deals massive damage to everyone. What makes it even more devastating on the battlefield, is the fact that you can control the trajectory of every bullet from third person view, assuring you can kill enemies hiding behind cover. Due to the amount of damage it does, it cannot be upgraded, and can only be used in certain parts of the game.RLS-7All The RLS-7 can only be picked up from fallen enemies, and then be used only for a couple shots. Acting as a typical rocket launcher, it does colossal amounts of damage, but has very scarce ammunition and takes a long time to re-load. Cannot be upgraded. weapons except the Seeker and the Rocket Launcher may be upgraded through the player's weapon locker using found weapon tech. It should also be noted that the Seeker and the Rocket Launcher are not available in the player's weapon locker.PowersAge/Renew - Probably the most necessary mechanic in the game, at least for the puzzles. This gives the player the ability to age/crush/destroy certain objects in the environment, or bring them back to a pristine state. The player can also age enemies to dust with this ability.Impulse - As soon as the player obtains the TMD, this ability replaces the player's knife as melee. Knocks back enemies and instantly kills weaker enemies.Grav Manipulation - Allows the player to catch/pickup/throw/put-down certain objects in the environment. One can also steal shields for enemies using this ability. Essentially this game's version of the Gravity GunDeadlock - Creates a bubble in which time practically stops. While the bubble expires in a fairly short amount of time, this ability can break the game if used too often.Reversion - Turns late-game enemies into blind, vomiting, vicious monsters who attack anything that makes noise. Age them once more to turn them into walking bombs.All of these powers use E99 energy, although some (Age on an enemy, Reversion, Impulse) consume far more resources than others.MultiplayerThe game features two multiplayer game types: Extermination and Monsters vs. Soldiers. Multiplayer is class-based. Two rounds make up a match.Extermination features a team of soldiers who must renew beacons and defend them for 20 seconds. The other team, the monsters, must stop them. There is a time limit of five minutes per beacon. 3 beacons make the match.Monsters vs. Soldiers is essentially team death match which features a team of soldiers vs. a team of monster.Soldier ClassesBlitzer - The Blitzer has the ability to teleport short distances at cost of E99 energy. Not only does this allow for use of shortcuts and passages that would otherwise be unusable, but it can also be a powerful weapon as teleporting into an enemy usually results in an instant kill.Bruiser - The Bruiser is able to use the Impulse ability. Great for those pesky Phase Ticks!Healer - The Healer has the ability to heal others (and thusly, heal himself). A great support character.Lurker - The Lurker has access to the shield ability. The shield ability absorbs a percentage of damage and, if the player stands still while the ability is active, they will be granted temporary ""invisibility"".All soldiers also have access to the Centurion and one other weapon of the player's choice that is chosen through the loadout screen.Monster ClassesRevert - A slow monster, but a powerhouse. Melee strength is high. Has the ability to vomit on enemies to damage them and slow them down (or vomit on friendlies to heal them), lay down 2 bile mines at a time.Zek - A quick, sneaky monster. Has the ability to spawn explosive barrels to throw at enemies, temporarily go invisible/invulnerable, execute a powerful ground stomp.Radion - Tank of the monster team. An arachnid-like creature with heavy armor on the front of its body. Can fire powerful fire balls and bouncing spikes.Phase Tick - A weak monster with great potential. Can hop onto enemies and possess them. Also can detonate torso to kill enemies (without necessarily killing oneself).PC System RequirementsOperating System: WindowsÂ® XP/Vista/Windows 7 (Does not support Windows 2000)Processor: Intel Dual Core 2.8 GHz or AMD Ahtlon 64 x2 Dual-Core 4800 or betterRAM Memory: 1 GB for XP, 2 GB for Vista/Win7Graphics Card: 3D hardware accelerator card required - 100% DirectXÂ® 9.0c-compliant 256 MB video card and drivers*DirectXÂ®: DirectXÂ® 9.0c (Included)Hard Drive: 8GB of uncompressed hard disk space (plus 400 MB for the WindowsÂ® swap file and 12 KB free for saved games)Sound Card: 100% DirectXÂ® 9.0c-compliant true 16-bit sound card and driversOther Requirements: A 100% WindowsÂ® XP/Vista/Windows 7-compatible computer systemKeyboard/Mouse:100% WindowsÂ® XP/Vista/Windows 7-compatible mouse, keyboard and drivers*Supported Chipsets for WindowsÂ® XP/Vista/Windows 7- All NVIDIAÂ® GeForceÂ® 8800 GT 256 MB RAM and better chipsets (excluding 9400 cards)- All ATI Radeonâ¢ X1800 256 MB RAM and better (excludes X1800 GTO, HD2400, HD2600, and HD3450)- Motherboard integrated video chipsets not supported",,,,,,,,,

1429460,Legendary Journeys Demo,0,Kevin French,Blind Monkey Games,0,0,1,,English,,," OverviewHercules: The Legendary Journeys is a Nintendo 64 and Game Boy Color game from Titus (based on the hit television show). It centers around one of the most popular Grecian myths, that of Heracles, or, as he is better known, Hercules. The game involves a combination of skirmishes with random enemies and bosses, elementary puzzles, and numerous trading sequences and side quests similar to the ones found in Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. The player can also play as two of Herc's friends, Lolaus and Serena (or the Golden Hind, as the half woman, half horse character is referred to in the game): they each have their own unique attacks and weapons. Legendary Journeys is known to have many bugs and technical issues (alongside its clunky controls) that make the game frustrating and unnecessarily difficult in numerous places. This game proved to be another high profile failure for the once beloved Titus as it continued to plunge deeper into the territory of poorly developed action/adventure games; directly following the release of the critically-despised Superman 64.Playable CharactersThough Hercules is the primary player character, the player does take control of Lolaus and the Golden Hind during certain moments of the game. Each of these characters have a unique control scheme; unfortunately, perhaps due to a lack of care in the game's development, the other two characters are both exceedingly difficult to control and considerably weaker than Hercules. Nonetheless, the character's attributes are listed below: Hercules - The strongest and most primarily used of the characters, Hercules' primary attack is the punch by way of pressing the B button. Upon holding the B button, Hercules can also use a ""super punch"" that does greater damage and can be used to break through weakened walls. Furthermore, although all characters will stun enemies after a certain number of hits (bosses excluded), Hercules is the only character capable of picking up and throwing enemies; instantly killing both the enemy and any other enemies with which the thrown one makes contact. Furthermore, Herc is the only character that can purchase potions from the tavern owner (who exists in all of the game's towns) that unleash lavish special attacks centered around four elements: earth, fire, lightning, and ice. The earth potion drops rocks from the sky upon his unexpecting enemies; the fire potion unleashes burning balls of molten lava upon Herc's adversaries; the lightning potion performs a similar attack by way of giant, thundering lightning bolts; and the ice potion temporarily freezes one's foe(s). These potions are accessed via the C buttons. Although Hercules is the most overpowered of the game's characters, his portions can be nonetheless difficult to play due to a weak camera and the lack of a lock-on system.Iolaus - The sidekick of Hercules, Iolaus is useful as the only character in the game capable of climbing vines (which have an odd graphical similarity to those in Ocarina of Time). However, once he has climbed said vines and reached whatever dangers await him at the top, he is faced with the difficulty of fighting with his exceedingly underpowered staff (perhaps he is Herc's sidekick for a reason, eh?). Iolaus is also useful in one instance in which the snowy alps can only be crossed by a body small enough to fit into the only available winter coat. Iolaus cannot leave any of his designated playable areas however, if the player tries, they are met with the message: ""Perhaps I should let Herc take care of this.""The Golden Hind - Though christened Serena in the television series, the game (for some unbeknownst reason) refers to her as The Golden Hind. This lady Centaur is, in fact, the weakest of the three characters. The Hind's only method of attack is the shooting of her arrows, done in a first person mode. Although the arrows can be shot in the standard third-person perspective, they are guaranteed to strike nothing unless the enemy lies directly in front of the Hind. The first-person mode is troubling however, as the controls are so unbearably clunky and difficult to use that the player will have almost certainly lost a considerable amount of health by the time he/she was even capable of training his/her sights upon his/her adversaries. Fortunately, The Golden Hind also has the smallest amount of game time between the three characters; and, like Lolaus, is restrained to her respective areas with a message identical to his.",,,,,,,,,

1429510,The Birthday,542,å­éèª,å­éèª,0,0,0,"Indie, RPG","English, Traditional Chinese",,,"OverviewThe third Parasite Eve game, exclusive to Sony portable platforms.StoryOverviewCult heroine Aya Brea returns in an all-new game for the PSP.The first Parasite Eve was the story of Aya Brea saving New York from a catastrophic mitochondrial takeover. The sequel placed Aya Brea on a special team called MIST that hunted down rouge mitochondrial enemies, and introduced several new characters to the series - Kyle Madigan, a romantic interest for Aya. It also introduced Eve, a clone of Aya who is just a child.3rd Birthday starts off a decade after this. Kyle Madigan and Aya have fallen in love and are getting married, and Aya has adopted Eve as her daughter. However, after an incident in a church on their wedding day - both were killed. Aya has lost her memories of the day, and was found years later.Soon afterwards, Twisted started to appear. Twisted are enemies that live outside time and space, and they have started to take over the world. Their nexus is called Babel, and it's the mission of the U.S. National Guard's elite ""The Dead March"" to destroy it. However, they failed and by 2013 America is in ruins.Aya Brea confronts her attackers at Time Zero.Now, CTI is attempting to rewrite the past. By sending Aya Brea into the months after the appearance of the Twisted, they hope to undo key events that led to their failure. But so much is still unexplained. Why does Aya have no memories of her past? Why is her personality so timid compared to the Aya of Parasite Eve 1 and 2? What happened to Kyle Madigan and Eve? The answers all lie in what happened on her wedding day, known as Time Zero.For 3rd Birthday, Aya will be sent ""overdiving,"" being sent through time and inhabiting the bodies of people in that time period. She will try to undo the deaths of her friends and uncover the mystery of where the Twisted came from.Main CharactersAya Brea CTI Special Agent, and the protagonist of Parasite Eve 1 and 2. In the North American release she is voiced by Yvonne Strahovski, known for previously voicing Miranda Lawson in Mass Effect 2 and also late of NBC's ""Chuck"". The Aya Brea in 3rd Birthday is much more unsure of herself than the character in the first two games, though this reason is explained in the game's ending.Hyde Bohrhead of the CTI Overdive Investigation. Voiced by Nolan North, the frequent winner and namesake of Giant Bomb's annual award ""The Northie"" for the game with the best Nolan North voice acting.Blank CTI ScientistHead of the CTI technological division. Also close colleague of Hyde.Gabrielle MonsignyA sniper and a gentler character of the CTI team. She dies in the course of episode 2.Thelonius CrayCTI Agent former member of Delta Force, a counter-terrorism unit in US Army.Hunter ""Boss"" OwenHead of the CTI. An older, gruff man with a dislike of Aya and a dislike of technology. Known as Karud Owen in the Japanese version.Kyle MadiganAya's fiance and primary love interest.Eve BreaA younger clone of Aya who she adopted following the events of Parasite Eve 2.Plot Summary3rd Birthday is broken into 6 chapters. Although most of the game's plot is shown through cutscenes, key facts are only discoverable by reading emails and briefings in between missions.Chapter 0 - Prologue.Ascent - where Aya Brea leaves the past and returns to her body in the present.On December 24, 2010, Aya, in wedding garment, was discovered on the street of St. Thomas Cathedral. In addition, she has also become an amnesiac, unable to recollect memories of her past. As a result, Hyde Bohr, a Danish scientist, took her in. Meanwhile, strange beings and organisms were beginning to appear in New York State. Before long, these beings began assaulting civilians, and in response the American government has decided to both conceal the fact that these organisms, known as the Twisted, exist and to create an organization in response to them. This organization is called the Counter Terrorism Unit in December 2010, which would eventually result in the formation of the CTI (Counter Twisted Investigation Team) in August 2011. Members of the CTI would eventually include but aren't limited to:On May 22, 2011, Twisted commenced an assault on the Peter Feldman department store in New York City. Although deployed SWAT teams were able to hold of the Twisted, around 200 civilians were killed. This resulted in the CTI. In the same month, analysis indicates that Aya Brea has the unique ability to travel throughout time, space and into people's minds. This ability will be dubbed as ""Overdive"" by Hyde Bohr. To complement Aya's abilities, the Overdive Device was created. It allows Aya to go back in time and overdive into people from the past.On December 24, 2012, huge plant-like/ tentacle-like structures called Babels began to emerge in New York City. The Army was powerless to stop the ascent of these towers and the Twisted began to attack en masse. Due to the enormous casualties and scale of the event, this day was to be known as ""The Beginning of the End"". Several more events followed, namely the Sacrifice Incident, would push humanity towards the brink of extinction.The game begins on December 24, 2013, during the three year anniversary of the first sightings of the Twisted. At this time, the CTI intends to use Aya to operate the Overdive Device in order to alter past events involving the Twisted so that the battle between the Twisted and the humans would be more favorable towards the latter side. Aya's first mission takes her into a squad of National Guardsmen stationed in Manhattan one year prior, helping eliminate Twisted en route to Club Sacrifice.Chapter 2 - The Sacrifice Incident (December 24, 2012)On the same day as the Babels emerged, there was a massive attack by the Twisted on Club Sacrifice in NYC. Although the National Guard was able to arrive on the scene (despite numerous casualties), the entire unit was annihilated thanks to a type of Twisted called ""Reapers"".Aya is tasked to go back in time to help the National Guard succeed in removing the Twisted from the area. Thanks to her, the National Guard was able to enter Club Sacrifice with less casualties and successfully repel the Twisted while defeating an advanced Twisted known as Helix.However, at the same time, Aya begins to regain pieces of her memory. While rescuing civilians she managed to find a survivor known as Emily Jefferson. Through this acquaintance, Aya managed to remember that there was another girl who really resembles her. Shortly thereafter, though, Emily grew into a special Twisted herself, and she was gunned down by Aya and the National Guard.GameplayOverdiveBy damaging enemies past a certain point, players can ""overdive"" into them and inflict heavy damage.Aya Brea's core ability in T3B; it is the vector by which she travels into the past in order to eliminate the Twisted. The term ""Overdive"" is a portmanteau of sorts; Aya is layering her consciousness ""Over"" that of a National Guardsman or other pertinent human in the past, while her physical form rests in the present at CTI headquarters - her vitals dropping to levels resembling a deep-sea ""Dive.""Using Overdive, Aya can maintain total battlefield control remotely by possessing otherwise NPC-operated soldiers in sequence. For cosmetic reasons, the possessed soldier will have Aya's appearance to the player - her body wonât actually be there, only her mind. Nevertheless, Aya is still putting her life on the line - if a human she's Overdived into dies before she is able to escape, her consciousness will be lost with them, leaving only an inert body in CTI's present.Overdive also has an offensive capability, in the form of Overdive Kill. The theory behind this ability stems from Overdive being incapable of transplanting Aya's consciousness into less developed creatures such as animals, resulting in violent psychosomatic shock to the Overdive target. After successfully saturating a Twisted with gunfire or hitting its weak point, Aya can make an instantaneous Overdive into the creature, causing massive damage or outright dissolving the target. Despite the explicit riskiness of the maneuver, Overdive Kill is the preferred method of eliminating Twisted - the cellular shock leaves no corpse on a killing blow, which would otherwise remain to deal caustic damage to bystanders even after death.Life and DeathAya's life and death affects the NPC she's possessed. When the controlled NPC is on the verge of dying the game slows down allowing the player to perform an Overdive and switch to another soldier if available. The death of all NPCs results in a Game Over screen.WeaponryWith most of Aya's own customizable weapons having a limited amount of ammo, the player will have to make strategic use of the varied weaponry carried by the different soldiers. When selecting a target to dive in, its weapon and current ammo count will be displayed. Once dived in, that weapon will be added to Ayaâs arsenal until the player decides to change to another NPC.Aya must fill three weapon slots, though the first slot is always filled by her default pistol with infinite (upgradeable) ammo. The fourth slot is filled by the NPC whose body you inhabit. Weapons may be upgraded with BP, obtained from defeating enemies.Six categories of weapon exist:- Pistols: Generally low damage and rate of fire, but often feature upgrades that improve Overdive Kill stun buildup and/or Liberation Gauge buildup.- Shotguns: Great for knockback, damage, and Overdive Kill buildup at close range, but hampered by low ammo capacity.- Assault Rifles: Good all-around performance with large ammo stocks that drain relatively quickly. Most can be customized in order to maximize either damage or Overdive Kill buildup.- Sniper Rifles: Must be aimed manually, making their use against moving and close targets limited, but their scopes enable Aya to spot and shoot the weak points of Twisted, enabling instant Overdive Kills. Ammo capacity roughly as limited as Shotguns'.- Grenade Launchers: Area-of-effect weapons with an improved range on Aya's handheld grenades, able to deal a lot of damage and Overdive Kill hitstun in a hurry to clustered or large targets. Abysmal ammo capacity.- Special: An assortment of weapons falling outside the above categories, usually only available after multiple playthroughs or in special situations such as Overdiving into armored vehicle operators. Excepting the Blaze Edge pistol, they value dealing fast damage above all else and cannot take advantage of lock-on. Special Weapons cannot be upgraded.LiberationIGN noted that during liberation mode, the player was ""liberated"" from the slow, clunky controls.Killing enemies increases the Liberation bar on the lower right of the HUD, and when the bar turns red, Aya can use Liberation. Liberation temporarily increases Aya's reflexes and lets her wield two pistols which fires rapidly and can easily enable Aya to use Overdive Kill.Liberation also takes a great toll on Aya's mind and body; her health will not be affected, but she will be stunned temporarily after Liberation ends unless her final act was a lethal Overdive Kill.Critical Reception3rd Birthday garnered mostly positive reviews, and a MetaCritic score of 70. IGN gave the game an 8.5. Reviewer Patrick Kolan said ""3rd Birthday has depth, great production values throughout, and the raw mechanics give PSP gamers a mostly satisfying RPG-shooter despite the system's inherent flaws, including a disappointing script."" He also went on to say it was a fresh start to the series, and protagonist Aya Brea deserved further adventures.GameSpot reviewer Carolyn Petit was far more critical, giving the game a 6.0. ""The 3rd Birthday has an intriguing story with an annoying heroine and unusual gameplay that makes for an occasionally thrilling experience, which is often undermined by stiff controls and frustrating difficulty,"" noted Petit. ""Some will find enduring the flaws a tolerable price to pay to experience Aya Brea's strange journey, but she has some serious growing up to do before her next birthday rolls around.""The game also garnered attention for the ""disappearing clothes"" of protagonist Aya Brea. As Brea took damage, her clothes became more and more damaged and she showed more and more skin. The clothes must then be repaired with BP to reduce damage. This mechanics exists for the sexier outfits that are unlocked, such as a maid's outfit and a cheongsam.Connection to Parasite EveIn a recent interview with the games director, Hajime Tabata stated that the, The 3rd Birthday is a new IP and not the continuation of the Parasite Eve series. The series only shares links with Aya and her back story and uses that as leverage for a new series rather than continuing on the Parasite Eve series. This is no longer a Parasite Eve game, hence the reason for the Parasite Even name not being used.Parasite Eve 2 finished the story for Parasite Eve, so we couldnât do a Parasite Eve III. We really thought Aya was such an attractive protagonist, so we didnât want to just leave her alone. We wanted to resurrect her in hope to make an Aya Brea series our next big franchise.Is The 3rd Birthday becoming the title for the franchise or just for this game in particular? We havenât really made our minds up yet. Weâd like to wait and see how the game is received by fans, so we can see what the name should be, what should be improved and what the series should be. What challenges we should overcome.Aya Brea sports a sexier look and her character has become a lot more timid in comparison to the Parasite Eve series. Tabata-san said the dramatic change in character is explained in the game and claimed that the sexy new look was not intentional.",,,,,,,,,

1429690,Summoner VR : The ruined village Demo,0,MINO ENTERTAINMENT INC,MINO ENTERTAINMENT INC,0,0,1,,English,,,"Overview Â Summoner is a third-person RPG developed by Volition and published by THQ. It was a launch title for the Playstation 2, and was released on October 25th, 2000. It was also ported to PC on 19th March, 2001, and Mac OS on 12th July, 2001. It recieved decent scores from reviewers, the PS2 version scoring 74 on metacritic. The sequel, Summoner 2, was released in September 2002.Â  GameplayÂ The gameplay uses fairly standard action RPG mechanics, including a fully controllable, four person party. The player has full control over their parties levelling, able to distribute attribute and skill points where they wish. The combat is a mix of real time and turn based, with the player able to execute 'chain attacks'. These are done by pressing a direction on the d-pad with the correct timing when a character attacks an enemy. The combat system is surprisingly deep, with weapon types factoring into their effectiveness against diffrerent creatures, as well as the weapon's magical affinity being compared to the creatures strengths and weaknesses. Thanks to the joy of a third dimension, having the higher ground in a fight will count in your favour. As you progress through the game, the main character, Joseph, gains the ability to summon creatures as powerful allies in battle. Once summoned, the player can fully control the creature if they wish. There are risks involved with summoning, however. If Joseph happens to fall unconcious while a summon is out, it could turn on your remaining party members, which often results in failure, as well as broken controllers. Alongside the robust combat system, Summoner contains an awful lot of text to read. The towns were fairly large, and most of the NPC's could be spoken to, if only briefly. Main characters often have a lot to say, most of it being important plot information. This focus was a large departure from the usual console RPG's of the day. Most NPC's would also offer sidequests wich offer an abundance of information on the lore of Medeva, the kingdom the game takes place in. The character you team up with through the game also have their own sidequests and storylines.Â  Plot Â Main character Joseph was born with the mark of the summoner on his hand. As a boy, he attempted to use his power to save his village, Ciran, from attack by summoning a demon. He isn't powerful enough to control said demon, which proceeds to kill his family, friends and neighbours while destroying the entire village. Joseph flees and vows to never use his powers again. The vow is (somewhat inevitably) broken when Medeva's neighboring kingdom, Orenia, invades. Orenia's king, Murod, is attempting to find the man born with the mark of the summoner. Joseph's main goal through the game is to find six rings (ligh, dark, earth, air, fire, water) in order to summon a super powerful beastie and defeat Murod.Â Â Extras Â After completing the game and viewing the credits, a computer animated version of the Dungon and Dragons sketchÂ titled ""Summoner Geeks"" plays. It was circulated on the internet as a promotional video before the release of the game. It featured characters from both Summoner and Red Faction.Â  (check out the video here:Â      http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-5331429585309819856# ) Â Â Â System requirementsÂ Â Microsoft Windows   Intel Pentium II or AMD K6-2 CPU    64MB RAM  4x CD drive 800MB hard disk space 8MB DirectX 8.0 compatible video card  DirectX 8.0 compatible sound card     Windows 95/98/ME Mac  300Â MHz PowerPC G3  or better CPU  64MB Ram   8  xCD drive 800MB hard disk  space  Mac OS 8.6 (not  Mac OS-X-native)Â   Sequel A sequel,  Summoner 2,   was released in 2002 .",,,,,,,,,

Nintendoâs take on the fighting game genre, of course, does things a little differently, up to four players can battle in a 3D arena using an eclectic cast of characters. The characters are equipped with a variety of extendable arms, which feel like loadouts, that increase the strategy of each fight. Gameplay Arms features thirteen fighters, some of which are downloadable content. Each fighter starts with three sets of original arms. The player can unlock the other sets of arms for any character to use by earning coins in a variety of modes. Each fighter has their own style and they all have their own rush attack that they can use when their attack meter is full. The player can also charge their attacks for added damage and other effects. The player can change character abilities and arms for different strategies to help them overcome opponents.Joy-Con motion controls and standard button controls can be used as well as the use of the Pro controller. Each arm has independent controls with a variety of input choices available to the player.Grand Prix is the standard âstoryâ mode in Arms. Here the player fights ten matches versus the computer to obtain the belt. There is also an offline Versus mode and Battle modes. There are also online matches but the player must complete level four of the Grand Prix before that option will open in the main menu.

Along with numerous hazards and traps, Bruce must survive against ninjas and his rival: the hulking ""Green Yamo"".As a multi-screen platformer, much of the game involves moving Bruce around the screen, unlocking paths to the next section (usually by collecting lanterns hung around the environment). Along with the ability to jump, crouch, and climb, Bruce has two attacks at his disposal: quick punches and flying kicks.In addition to standard single-player and alternating multiplayer, the game includes a mode in which two players play simultaneously, with the supporting player playing as Yamo. The Yamo player can be supportive (as he can also attack the ninjas) or combative (as he can attack Bruce) and has unlimited lives.The game received ports to numerous ports from 1984-1986, including a first-party port to North American IBM-compatible PCs, ports to Japanese computers by Comptiq (including the NEC PC-8801, FM-7, MSX, and Sharp X1), and ports to multiple computers in Europe (including the ZX Spectrum by Ocean, the Amstrad CPC by Timedata, and the BBC Micro by Micro Power).

1428130,DARK MAGIC,199,FEDOS CHANNEL,FEDOS CHANNEL,0,0,0,"Action, Adventure, Casual, Indie",English,,,"OverviewDark Messiah of Might and Magic is a first-person spin-off of the long-running Might & Magic franchise. The story follows Sareth, a wizard's apprentice, in his attempts to retrieve the ""skull of shadows"", an artifact found near the beginning of the game. The game was developed by Arkane Studios, makers of Arx Fatalis and later Dishonored.GameplayDark Messiah's gameplay mixes first-person melee combat with RPG elements, similar to the Elder Scrolls series. A variety of weapons are available, including swords, staves, and bows. Each weapon or armor type has several variants with different enchantments that enhance their properties.Much importance is placed on using the environment in combat. Throwing or kicking enemies against spike beds, off cliffs, into fire, or into breakaway supports are among the most effective strategies.Later, the player earns demonic powers that grant added strength when using melee, but slowly siphons health as a consequence (as well as frightening nearby friendly NPCs, which can cause mission failure).Up-close and personal melee combatDark Messiah also features a skill system similar to those found in other RPGs. By accomplishing missions or reaching specific points, the player earns skill points which may then be used to unlock and develop new skills and techniques. The points can be placed into three categories:CombatMagicMiscellaneousThis allows the player to specialize their character to their personal needs. There is no way to max out all skill trees in a playthrough, even by completing optional mission objectives, so specialization is encouraged.The game has up to four multiple endings, though all choices appear only in the last two levels. The first choice relies on completing an optional objective to purge Sareth of his demonic abilities, and the second is immediately after the final boss on whether to join or destroy the soon-to-be-awakened lord of darkness.Dark Messiah also has an inventory system. Items can be picked up from dead enemies, looted from crates, given, or pickpocketed, similar to many other RPG releases.Combat SkillsMelee CombatLevel 1: Flurry of Blows - Allows Sareth to deliver an unlimited number of Fast Strikes in a flurry.Level 2: Charge - A powerful attack to stun enemies.

1428250,Crusaders of the Lost Idols: Imani Epic Starter Pack,999,Codename Entertainment Inc.,Codename Entertainment Inc.,0,0,0,"Casual, Free to Play, Indie",English,,,"Crusaders of the Lost Idols is a side-scrolling incremental (clicking/idle) game developed and published by Codename Entertainment, with an initial release on Facebook and Kongregate on July 23, 2015. The game was released on Steam on Oct. 13, 2015.The game's story elements take the player and a team of ""Crusaders"" through various locales, completing objectives in order to earn extra gold and treasure chests that can sometimes contain loot to further improve the characters.Crusaders of the Lost Idols is a Free to Play game currently supported through microtransactions for treasure chests in a manner similar to Counter-Strike: Global Offensive or the multiplayer portion of Mass Effect 3.GameplaySimilar to many incremental games of its kind, Crusaders of the Lost Idols requires the player to click on monsters to attack them, gather gold on defeat of the monsters and use the gold to buy levels for the clicker player-character or to hire Crusaders that deliver a base amount of damage per second (DPS). The Crusaders can also be leveled, and all characters have certain upgrades at set level milestones that can be purchased with gold to unlock abilities or flat damage boosts to the character or to all members of the party.The Crusaders and the player-character are placed on a side-scrolling landscape in the formation of bowling pins (four in the back row, three in the row to the right, etc.), with a maximum party size of 10 Crusaders or 9 Crusaders and the clicker player character.The party formation is one of the twists Crusaders of the Lost Idols provides in its game. Some characters have upgrades that are only in effect when the party is in a certain formation. For example, Emo Werewolf receives a significant DPS boost when no other human Crusaders are next to him in the formation. Other characters fill familiar RPG roles such as Healer, Tank and Buffer through these formation-based upgrades.This formation setup allows for different combinations that players can use to min-max either base DPS damage or base click damage, to boost certain upgrades, to better prepare for boss battles with damage mitigation and healing, or to farm gold for leveling/upgrading.The progression through the game involves four normal levels with MMO-style quest objectives requiring special item drops or a certain number of monsters killed. The fifth level in each five-level section of the game's map is a boss wave, and upon defeat of the boss a treasure chest will drop that can contain various consumable buffs, items that increase the effectiveness of Crusaders or the CPC, or lump sums of gold.

The title was initially released in Japan simultaneously for the PlayStation 4 and Nintendo 3DS on July 29, 2017. Square Enix released Dragon Quest XI in North America and Europe on September 4, 2018, for the PlayStation 4 and the PC via Steam. The localized version featured several improvements, including newly added voice acting that was not present in the Japanese release, reworked menus, and an extra difficulty mode, among other additions. A year later, Dragon Quest XI's enhanced port was released for the Nintendo Switch in 2019 around the world under the name Dragon Quest XI S.StoryThe game is set in the world of Erdrea and begins as the kingdom of Dundrasil is invaded and destroyed by an army of monsters. The protagonist, an infant during the attack, survives and is found floating down a river by an older man named Chalky in the village of Cobblestone. The protagonist is adopted by Chalky's daughter Amber and raised in the village. After the protagonist's coming-of-age ceremony, Amber reveals the truth to him about his birth and adoption and sends him to meet King Carnelian of Heliodor. However, the king accuses him of being an evil entity and throws him into the dungeons. Imprisoned, the protagonist meets a thief called Erik, who reveals that he was sent to meet him, as the mark on his hand is proof that he is the Luminary, a legendary hero chosen by the world tree Yggdrasil to save Erdrea from evil. The pair escape and evade capture, later joined by two mages: Veronica, trapped in a child's body due to a curse, and her twin sister, Serena. On their quest to help the Luminary reach the sacred tree Yggdrasil, they gain three other companions: Sylvando, a traveling entertainer, Rab, former king of Dundrasil and the protagonist's grandfather, and Jade, exiled princess of Heliodor who helped the infant protagonist escape during the attack of Dundrasil.The party eventually arrives at the heart of Yggdrasil, which contains the Sword of Light, the Luminary's destined weapon. However, just as the Luminary is about to take it, he and the party are intercepted by Carnelian and his retainers Jasper and Hendrik. It is revealed that Carnelian was possessed by an evil sorcerer known as Mordegon and that Jasper is Mordegon's agent. The two subdue Hendrik and the Luminary's party, with Mordegon taking the Sword of Light and absorbing the heart of Yggdrasil, destroying the tree and plunging the world into an age of darkness. The Luminary returns to Cobblestone, separated from the others, turned into a fortified refuge for Heliodor citizens led by Carnelian and Hendrik. They apologize to the Luminary for all the troubles they caused him. Hendrik joins forces with the Luminary, and together they reclaim Heliodor from Mordegon's forces. After reuniting with the rest of the party, except for Veronica, who perished saving the others during the fall of Yggdrasil, the Luminary obtains the means to forge a new Sword of Light, which they use to defeat Jasper and Mordegon, which restores Yggdrasil and the world.Afterward, the party discovers the means to bring Veronica back within the Tower of Lost Time. There they meet the Timekeeper, who gives the Luminary the power to go back in time and defeats Mordegon before he can steal the Sword of Light and Yggdrasil's heart, thus saving Veronica from sacrificing herself. However, due to Mordegon's absence, a dark spirit is able to summon forth a mysterious orb called Erdwin's Lantern and merge with it, thus awakening the game's true antagonist, The Dark One, Calasmos, who was previously destroyed in the timeline of Mordegon's rule. The party learns that a prior Luminary named Erdwin was betrayed and killed by his mage companion Morcant, who absorbed Calasmos's powers and transformed into Mordegon. Since he could not be destroyed forever without the power of the Luminary, Serenica, Erdwin's former sage companion and lover, then sealed the weakened Calasmos within Erdwin's Lantern and attempted to return to the past at the Tower of Lost Time, but was turned into the Timekeeper instead. The party then confronts and destroys Calasmos before the Luminary entrusts his mark to Serenica, who reverts to her original form and uses it to return to the past and reunite with Erdwin. Accompanied by Veronica and Serena, he also returns the Sword of Light to Yggdrasil, who reveals itself to be Yggdragon, an ancient dragon of light defeated by Calasmos ages ago, whose body transformed into the tree Yggdrasil and gave life to Erdrea. Yggdragon bestows upon the Luminary the title of ""Erdrick,"" the mightiest of all heroes, and keeps the Sword for the day when a new hero will need it to defend Erdrea from evil. In the mid-credits, Serenica reunites with Erdwin in the past, while after the credits, a young mother, after reading the Luminary's story in a book, wakes up her child from the bed, setting up the beginning of Dragon Quest III.Version DifferencesThe two different releases of Dragon Quest XI were co-developed by an additional company for each iteration. The PlayStation 4 version saw assistance from ORCA, who used Unreal Engine 4 to develop the title, and Toylogic collaborated with Square Enix to created the 3DS version. Both interpretations of XI feature a polygonal 3D presentation, with the PS4 containing fully proportioned characters while the 3DS has a more super-deformed art style. However, the 3DS version contains an option to experience the entire game with a classic 2D sprite-based art style as well, which in the game's opening hours, is displayed on the 3DS's bottom screen while the 3D visuals play out on the top screen. The PS4 release also contains two different options for the battle camera: a traditional camera style, where the party members are arranged in a line in front of the enemies similar to past entries in the series, as well as a real-time camera where the player can directly control the hero during battles and move the camera around freely, although it does not affect gameplay in any way. So in total, with all the different iterations and graphical modes, there are three distinct versions of Dragon Quest XI that all contain the same story but vastly different presentations.The Nintendo Switch port, published two years after the previous versions, combined elements from both the PlayStation 4 and Nintendo 3DS releases. The core game featured the same presentation as the PS4 edition along with the 3DS version's ability to swap to the 2D sprite-based graphical style. Along with containing all of the optional side-quests exclusive to the 2D version of the game, the Nintendo Switch port also featured a plethora of gameplay tweaks, new story content, a photo mode, orchestrated music, and Japanese voice acting among many other improvements. Once again, Dragon Quest XI was ported to even more platforms in 2020, with the Definitive Edition being released for the Xbox One, along with the PC and PS4, which was identical to the Switch release in terms of content but with better graphical fidelity.PlayStation 4PlayStation 4Nintendo 3DS (3D) Nintendo 3DS (3D) Nintendo 3DS (2D)Nintendo 3DS (2D)TriviaThe development of Dragon Quest XI initially began on the PlayStation 4 and was initially planned to be released exclusively for the system. However, Square Enix wanted to have the game available on the Nintendo 3DS due to the system's much larger installed base in Japan. Yuji Horii agreed to the idea after it was suggested that the 3DS version could have a feature to switch between 2D and 3D graphical styles in order for 3DS players not to feel like they were getting an inferior version of the game.Even though the title would not be released on the platform until two years after its launch, the Nintendo Switch version of Dragon Quest XI was one of the very first titles to be announced for the system. Way back in 2015, when the game was initially revealed to the public, Square Enix mentioned that XI was in development for Nintendo's new system, which was being called the ""NX"" at the time.",,,,,,,,,

It will be released for the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4 on December 14, 2021.Each match of Among Us follows a 4-15 man crew as they navigate the space base in a top-down fashion and complete tasks (as simple mini-games) to keep the crew alive. However, some members of the crew are secretly given the role of ""impostor"", whose goal instead is to murder the other crewmates undetected (as they risk being voted off, similar to other social deduction games).The game support cross-platform multiplayer between all platforms and was originally intended to be used as a multi-screen party game. While the game received limited attention on release, it received a sharp increase in popularity in 2020 following the studio's next release The Henry Stickmin Collection and the popularity of online multiplayer party games during the COVID-19 pandemic.In 2019, the game received additional bases as paid DLC (""MIRA HQ"" and ""Polus Outpost""), each introducing new cosmetic and gameplay changes. Both bases were made free on June 11, 2020, with some cosmetics available as separate DLC. A third base, ""Airship"", was released on March 31, 2021.A sequel was announced in August 2020, but was quickly cancelled a month later. Further development was put into the original game in updates, adding new quality-of-life updates such as an updated text chat system using a series of pre-set phrases (intended for console players and younger audiences). It later received an official VR spin-off in 2022, known as Among Us VR.GameplayCrewmatesThe majority of the players are Crewmates, whose goal is to either vote out all Impostor players or to complete all assigned tasks scattered throughout the base.While they cannot kill players directly, they can call a group meeting (either by discovering a dead body or by pressing a special ""emergency"" button somewhere in the map), where they discuss and perform a majority vote to determine who to jettison off the base to their death. While this is used to eliminate Impostor players, players can be deceived to eliminate Crewmate players instead.Dead crewmates, as ghosts, cannot directly interact with the other players but can help complete tasks.With the release of the November 2021 roles update, players can enable three additional ""roles"", which are given to Crewmates at random:Scientist - Can use the ""Vitals"" ability, which pulls up a tablet to check which players are dead regardless of location. This ability recharges by completing tasks.Engineer - Can use the ""Vent"" ability, which allows them to use same ventilation shafts as Impostors. This ability recharges after 30 seconds, by default.Guardian Angel - Only given to the first Crewmate that dies. Can use the ""Protect"" ability to shield a player from a Kill. This ability recharges after 60 seconds, by default.ImpostorsThe minority of the players are secretly Impostors, whose goal is to eliminate all Crewmate players (by either having them voted out or by murdering them directly).Unlike Crewmates, Impostors have special abilities that can aid them in sabotaging other players. They are given a fake list of tasks that can be used as an alibi and can traverse the base quickly by using special ventilation shafts. They can also sabotage key systems of the base, either forcing Crewmates to manage them or locking out areas.Dead impostors, as ghosts, cannot directly interact with the other players but can help sabotage.With the release of the November 2021 roles update, players can enable an additional ""role"" given to Impostors at random:Shapeshifter - Can use the ""Shift"" ability, which allows them to temporarily change their appearance into another player. This ability lasts 60 seconds and recharges after 10 seconds, by default.",,,,,,,,,

1426690,Devil May Cry 4 Original Soundtrack,1799,"CAPCOM CO., LTD.","CAPCOM CO., LTD.",0,0,0,,,,,"OverviewThe first appearance of the Devil May Cry series on the 360 & PS3 console hardware, Devil May Cry 4 once again let players step into the shoes of the demonic demon hunter Dante, as well as series newcomer (and Dante lookalike) Nero. This is the first entry of the franchise to appear on a Microsoft console (excluding the DMC3 PC port). Devil May Cry 4 adds some small changes to the formula used in the last game, but doesn't stray far from its predecessors.Devil May Cry 4: Special Edition, an enhanced port with additional playable characters and other new features, was released on the PS4, Xbox One and PC in 2015.GameplayThe core gameplay in DMC4 remains unchanged from the previous installments; which means you kill demons as stylishly as possible by using fancy combos and agile acrobatic maneuvers. Both characters (Nero and later Dante) have a sword button and a gun button, and the two can alternate between the attacks on the fly. Sword attacks can be modified by the timing in which the button is pressed(holding the button as opposed to tapping the button as opposed to pressing the button and waiting a second), while gun attacks can be modified by charging the blast(which can be done by holding the gun button. Characters still lock onto enemies before attacking, and locking on allows players to launch opponents into the air, drive into them with the sword, or send them flying down to earth, depending on which direction the control stick is pressed while locked on. The player has control over the camera, but that control is frequently taken away by the game to show a more cinematic angle of a location and actually turning the camera takes a bit more time than in other games.Nero has a few key differences from series hero Dante that change his combat style slightly. Firstly, Nero has the ""Devil Bringer"" a glowing, demonic right arm that allows him to grab opponents in combat and throw them(both on the ground and in the air). Nero can also pull opponents towards him from a distance by using the Devil Bringer while locked onto a target. The Devil Bringer in game boils down to another type of attack to use against enemies, but its more useful as a means of getting around larger opponents: Nero can latch onto opponents when throwing out a demonic projection of his devil arm and jump over the enemy, leaving them exposed to sword, gun and fists.The Red Queen Sword is the blade Nero wields throughout the game. By holding the left trigger before or during combat (provided that Nero isn't performing any other combat action) will cause Nero to ""rev"" the Red Queen Sword(which can be seen in the top left corner of the screen) with blazing heat. If Nero charges the blade enough, he'll store a point of heat charge (called ""Exceed"" in the game) . Nero can rev and fill the sword with, initially, three Exceed points. When the sword has stored points, Nero's next sword attack will become faster and more powerful. However, there's only a one-shot charge to each point: the minute Nero swings his sword (in combat or out of combat, even if he isn't targeting an enemy) he will expend an Exceed point. Since players can't ""rev"" the sword in the middle of combat, players will have to decide whether to go into combat, or to lay off the offensive and charge the sword up before diving in. Players will also have to decide the best ways to use stored Exceed points, since they can be expended so quickly. Nero, however, has one trick up his sleeve when using the Red Queen's charging move: if the player presses the left trigger as his sword collides with a target he will instantly gain a point of Exceed charge, making his next attack faster and more powerful. Players can also utilize the advanced version of this skill by purchasing an upgrade that will completely max out the Exceed gauge if the left trigger is pressed at the exact time Nero's sword hits a target. This move will boost Nero's combat effectiveness, but the timing to nail the move will challenge even seasoned players. However, a player skilled using this move will, essentially, have unlimited Exceed charges, making them much more powerful in combat.Additionally, Nero has a handful of abilities that, when used after building up one or more Exceed charges, become completely different abilities. These new abilities usually have a wider range and deal much more damage than their un-charged versions. The powered up abilities tend to have the prefix ""Ex-"" applied to their names as in Ex-Calibur, the powered up version of the ability ""Calibur"". There is also an ability that allows the player to expend all their built up Exceed points in one single, extremely powerful attack by using one of the ""Ex-"" abilities with a maxed Exceed gauge.Nero, like Dante, can activate his ""Devil Trigger"", once he gets Yamato. This move will let Nero transform into his demon form for a brief period of time, making his attacks stronger and faster. By dispatching enemies with panache your style meter goes up, a high meter will net you more red orbs after you kill enemies. Red orbs are used to buy restorative items. There is another form of ""currency"" in DMC4 called proud souls. At the end of a level you're graded and your letter grade determines how much proud souls you get. These are used to buy new moves and abilities. DMC4 is also the first game in the series to allow the player ""sell"" purchased upgrades back. Any ability bought with Proud Souls can be exchanged for a refund equal to the cost of the upgrade. This allows players to customize their character's progression while allowing leeway for some experimentation.In addition to its combat system there are also some segments of platforming and puzzle solving.Difficulty LevelsThe game can be played in many different difficulty modes. In order of difficulty they are:HumanDevil HunterSon of SpardaDante Must DieHeaven or HellHell and HellLegendary Dark Knight (PC)PlotThe game opens with Nero making his way to an opera house whereupon he finds his path blocked by a group of demons. As a beautiful young woman named Kyrie sings at his destination, Nero slays the demons with ease and style, before making his way to the House. When he arrives, he sits and as Kyrie approaches, it becomes evident the two have a relationship. Nero begins to express his boredom when suddenly his own Demon Arm begins to glow...Nero fighting BerialCrashing through the roof, Dante infiltrates the church and murders Sanctus, the High Priest of the Order of the Sword; a Pope-equivalent religious figure in this game's world. Nero, a member of the Order, understands the danger Kyrie is in and battles Dante, seemingly defeating him before Dante shows that he was just teasing Nero. Dante escapes and Nero leaves the church when he is assigned by Credo, the leader of the knights in the Order, to hunt down Dante. As Nero goes after Dante he learns more about the truth behind the Order and the leader Sanctus, he also begins to wonder if Dante is even the real threat. Pushing through the city, from it's urban areas to it's forested landscapes before finding himself at the Headquarters of the Order, Nero battles demons and learns that a distinctly despicable character named Agnus is conducting experiments regarding Demonology.Later, when Nero makes it to the Order Credo appears and explains that his Holiness has been resurrected and has directed Credo to kill Nero. Transforming into an 'Angelic' version of himself, he battles Nero, who remarks that Credo is no angel, but a demon. After defeating Credo, Kyrie appears and is disturbed by Nero standing over a beaten Credo, baring his Demon Arm. Nero tries to convince her that she doesn't understand. At this point Agnus appears and kidnaps Kyrie taking her to the highest confines of the Headquarters.Fighting his way through headquarters, Nero eventually meets Dante again, who always seems to be one step ahead of Nero. Dante mentions that the sword Nero holds (which Nero found in Agnus' lair) belonged to his brother Vergil, and that he wants to 'keep it in the family'. After a brief scuffle, Nero realizes that Dante is toying with him and Dante tells him to keep the sword. Nero proceeds without giving him the blade.At the top of headquarters, Nero comes across his Holiness, Sanctus, who has gone so far as to bring a giant statue of Sparda (known as the Savior) to life in order to vanquish evil. Nero battles with Sanctus for Kyrie's soul and seems victorious, until the Savior finally manages to grab a hold of him. At this point, Dante appears and tells Nero to give him his sword back. Nero tells Dante to come and get it, before giving Dante the finger as he is forced into the Savior...Inside the Savior, Nero finds Kyrie and reaches out but the moment he touches her, she appears to disintegrate into nothingness. Vowing to get the two of them out, Nero slips away, also.Outside the Savior, however, Dante watches as Agnus summons all the demons of hell to wreak havoc over the great city. Suddenly, before anyone is hurt, a series of Angelic Guard creations and the Savior eradicate them all and the townspeople feel safe.

An iPhone version of the gameÂ was released on the Apple App Store on July 11 2009. Worms is a light hearted turn based strategy game of open warfare between multiple teams of wormsÂ on destructible landscapes.Â Â The game allows you to create a squad of four worms; each worm can be given a unique nickname which appears above their heads during gameplay. You can also name the squad and choose from various grave stones (these replace dead Worms) and select humorous voices from the voice bank. Gameplay The last team standing wins andÂ the game is played in turns. A different member of a team is selected with each turn and is able to use one of a large arsenal of weapons and tools or move around the map. Each turn has a time limit to completed and has a 'retreat time' to get your worm to safety at the end of the turn. You win the game by using your weapons to either reduce your opponents worms health down to zero or by knocking them off the map. Each round has a timer and when the timer reaches zero, the game goes in to 'sudden death' and all remaining worms health is reduced to zero and the water at the bottom of the landscape begins to rise. Tutorial There are 3 tutorial missions that will introduce you to the controls and teach you how to play the game.  Campaign The campaign of theÂ game consists of 20 'Challenge' missions that places you in to a death match against 3 AI opponents. The AI is made up 3 teams, each of varying difficulties, and the challenges get harder as you progress. Multiplayer Multiplayer mode allows up to 4 players to battle against each other Offline on Local Play or Online through Xbox LIVE.

This weapon, along with others were added to the Playstation 3 release. However, It should be noted that new weapons will not be available for future download.",,,,,,,,,

1426300,The Binding of Isaac: Repentance,0,"Nicalis, Inc., Edmund McMillen","Nicalis, Inc.",0,0,0,"Action, Adventure, RPG",English,,,"OverviewThe game's starting room, with all controls shown.The Binding of Isaac is an indie horror action-adventure game developed and published digitally by Edmund McMillen and Florian Himsl for the PC (via Steam) on September 28, 2011. It was later made available for the Mac and was included in some Humble Bundles (with Linux support starting on December 19, 2012).Built on Adobe Flash from one of the original creators of Super Meat Boy, The Binding of Isaac has players take control of Isaac, a naked (though not explicitly) crying child who must venture deeper down the dungeons beneath his bedroom floor to escape his religious sacrifice by his deranged mother. Along the way, he must fight demented monsters (using his tears as projectiles) and collect a variety of twisted powerups (mostly based on biblical, crude, and childlike themes).The gameplay combines the claustrophobic twin-stick shooting of Robotron: 2084 with the room-based dungeon crawling aspects of The Legend of Zelda. The game is known for focusing on repeated playthrough attempts using roguelike elements (namely perma-death and procedurally-generated dungeons) and unlockable content (requiring numerous successful playthroughs to unlock them all). It is also known for its item system, as each playthrough contains a different random set of passive and active items for players to find (allowing them to create unique and monstrous combinations).The game later received an expansion pack, titled The Binding of Isaac: Wrath of the Lamb, on May 28, 2012. Along with over 100 new items (including new pickup types, such as ""eternal hearts"" that add a risk/reward element), this expansion includes new room types, a new unlockable character, a challenge mode (in which players must complete a goal starting with a certain handicap), alternate floor themes (which include a new variety of enemies and bosses), and a new endgame. This expansion later received an update by Himsl (with no involvement from McMillen) on May 2, 2015, titled ""Eternal Edition"". Along with bugfixes, it adds a special ""hard mode"" that features challenging ""Eternal"" versions of the game's enemies and bosses.On November 4, 2014, the game received a remake by Nicalis (under creative control from McMillen), titled The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth, which rebuilds the engine (allowing them to bypass limitations of the Flash engine, such as console ports and native controller support) and adds a variety of new content and both visual and audio updates. While the contents from the first expansion pack are included in the remake's base game, the contents of Eternal Edition is not.In Europe, the game received two retail boxed releases in 2012 (both by Merge and Headup): the Unholy Edition (released before the expansion) and the Most Unholy Edition (released after the expansion).GameplayJudas evading a group of globins.The Binding of Isaac is, according to its creator Edmund McMillen, ""a roguelike shooter based on the dungeon structure of the NES version of Zelda"" and instead of using a traditional leveling system, the game uses an item system and there will be 4 sets of special items; usable items, special weapon upgrades, passive upgrades and stat boosters. In every level there will be a treasure room, shop, boss and other secret/special rooms which might contain unique items. Most of the items stack, meaning that over the course of the game the player's character will become a ""monstrous powerhouse"" in both stats and abilities as well as appearance.There are also ""micro puzzles"" which use pickup items (coins, bombs, keys, hearts, cards and pills) to allow the player to acquire special items, gain access to shops/hidden areas, kill enemies and affect the gameplay in other ways.Character ProgressionCharacter progression in the game is treated as a mix between games such as Spelunky, Desktop Dungeons, and Super Crate Box. Item drops, enemies, rooms, characters, bosses, endings, and chapters are all unlocked as players complete certain objectives. The goal of this system is make the game's content feel richer as players spend more time with the game.Difficulty MechanicsUsers playing the ""basic"" game who find themselves struggling will be given helper items, whose purpose is to aid the player and make the game easier for them. For players who are doing well, the game will have more challenging bosses, extra chapters, and an overall increase in difficulty.CharactersFive playable characters launched with the game: Isaac, Magdalene, Cain, Judas, and ???. Eve was added to the game in the Halloween update, and the Wrath of the Lamb DLC added Samson. All of the characters (with the exception of ??? which is based on a character previously created by Edmund) closely resemble standard DnD classes; Fighter, Thief, Cleric, Wizard, Druid, and Berserker.IsaacThe FighterIsaac: The FighterUnlocked from start.Health: 3; Damage: 2; Range: 2; Speed: 2; ROF: 2.Starting Item: The D6 (Must be unlocked)Starting pickup item: BombMagdalene (aka, Maggy and Magdalena)Magdalene: The ClericThe ClericUnlocked by getting 7+ container hearts in one playthrough.Health: 4; Damage: 2; Range: 2; Speed: 1; ROF: 2.Starting Item: Yum HeartStarting pickup item: NoneCainThe ThiefCain: The ThiefUnlocked by having 55+ pennies in one playthrough.Health: 2; Damage: 3; Range: 1; Speed: 3; ROF: 2.Starting Item: Lucky FootStarting pickup item: KeyJudasThe WizardJudas: The WizardUnlocked by completing The Womb.Health: 1; Damage: 4; Range: 2; Speed: 2; ROF: 2.Starting item: Book of BelialStarting pickup item: 3x PennyEveEve: The DruidThe DruidUnlocked by making two deals with the devil during one playthrough.Health: 2; Damage: 2; Range: 2; Speed: 2; ROF: 2.Starting items: Dead Bird and Whore of Babylon.Starting pickup item: None??????: The Blue BabyThe Blue BabyUnlocked by completing the game 10 times.Health: 0; Damage: 2; Range: 2; Speed: 2; ROF: 2.Starting Item: A PoopStarting pickup item: 3x Soul HeartsSamson (only available in the The Wrath of the Lamb DLC)The BerserkerSamson: The BerserkerUnlocked by skipping two treasure rooms and beating Mom in one playthrough.Health: 1; Damage: 2; Range: 1; Speed: 2; ROF: 1Starting Item: Blood LustStarting pickup item: 1x Soul HeartsUnlocking each character will also unlock their special item as a pickup in the main game regardless of which character is being used.

In addition to numerous modes and difficulty settings, the game features a new gameplay mechanic: the Double Gear system (which allows the titular hero, at will, to either slow down time or perform powerful attacks).Set in the year 20XX, the game takes place sometime after the events of Mega Man 10 (in which the humanoid robot hero Mega Man defeats the evil Dr. Wily for the tenth time). Reminded of a past confrontation with Dr. Light, Dr. Wily continues his research on a past invention: the Double Gear (a circuit that pushes robots beyond their normal speed and strength). Brainwashing more of Dr. Light's robots for research, it's up to Mega Man (with a prototype Double Gear installed) to stop Dr. Wily.",,,,,,,,,

1426560,Ghost Opear House å§é¢é­å½±,999,Jian Ou,Jian Ou,0,0,0,"Action, Indie, RPG, Simulation, Strategy","English, Simplified Chinese",,,"OverviewGhost House is an 1982 Arcade game developed by Sega that was later adapted to be one of their earliest Sega Master System games in 1986. It was one of the last games to be released on the Sega Card format, which was phased out later the same year.Ghost House's protagonist Mick superficially resembles Sega's famous mascot Alex Kidd, as a protagonist who uses an enormous fist to punch enemies into submission, and the game takes place on multiple screens of an immense house filled with spooky creatures and secrets.StoryThe story of Ghost House is very simple: The player is Mick, a nondescript boy who has inherited a fortune. The problem is that all the treasures are scattered in a haunted house. To make matters worse they are even guarded by Dracula himself. So Mick sets out to battle Dracula and his clones to get back what is his.GameplayThe gameplay of Ghost House is as simple as the story. In every level Mick has to collect keys which are dropped by enemies he defeats. With these keys he can open a coffin in which Dracula or one of his four clones is located. After Mick has defeated all of the Dracula clones and Dracula himself, he advances to the next round. There are six rounds in total. The background of the house is always the same, though, only the color changes.Mick has two different ways of disposing of his enemies: He can punch them like Alex Kidd, or jump on their head like Mario. Depending on which foe he faces, one of the two attacks will prove to be more viable. It can be pretty risky to punch the Fire Blower for example.EnemiesThere are five different enemies in the game:Derobat: Derobats are little bats which can be found in large quantities in every level. They can be killed with one blow, but they can easily fly into Mick's face, too.Death: Contrary to the Death we know, this Death is slow and easy to defeat. He only creeps around the house slowly, without being able to attack.Fire Blower: The Fire Blower is a dangerous creature. Not only can he take a lot of hits, he also blows fire.The Mummy: A horrible fellow who follows Mick around the house.Dracula (and his clones): He can turn into a bat and attack Mick from above. Very dangerous.Apart from these enemies Mick can also be attacked by flying knives and arrows which suddenly fly through the screen. Very hard to avoid.TriviaGhost House is one of only eight Sega Master System games that were initially released on Sega Card outside of Japan. The other seven were: Super Tennis, Teddy Boy, Hang-On, My Hero, TransBot, Spy vs. Spy and F-16 Fighting Falcon.Ghost House has been voted into the 15 worst video game covers by 1UP.",,,,,,,,,

1425690,Eden's Lair,499,Hallowed-Gin,Hallowed-Gin,0,0,0,Action,English,,,"GameplayRohn atop his dragon during a battle.Lair is a game that has a very unique control and gameplay mechanism. You use the PlayStation 3's Sixaxis technology to fly your dragon ar ound various terrain and battlefields while accomplishing an array of different tasks. The game plays much like a flight simulator in the way that you have to react quickly and precisely to accomplish your goal. At the end of each level you are given a score and sometimes different bonuses like extra health.To help with aiming, since there isn't a crosshair, there is a slight fog around your target. It does take some getting used to, but by the time you are comfortable with the controls, this feature feels easy to use as well. Also, the game is controlled with sixaxis to fly, but things like fireballs, fire breath, ground combat, ground movement, boosting, and braking, are all controlled using the buttons on the controller. The layout can be found in the games manual.Some of the more interesting events occur in ground combat, where you can eat enemies to gain health, flame and fireball enemies, slash enemies, whip enemies with your tail, and there are even some enemies where you can grab them (when flying past) and drop them on the field on a bombing view mode. Some of the more spectacular air combat includes you pitting your will against an enemy dragon rider and basically mashing the controller to overtake the opponent in a strategic button masher scenario. Also, you can fly next to a dragon in the sky, use the sixaxis to ram them, and eventually activate the button mashing take down or a quick time event scenario where you jump on the enemy dragon and stab them.StoryThe story revolves around two civilizations, the Mokai and the Asylians. The Mokai come from lands which are arid and scarce in natural resources. Out of necessity for their survival, they attack the Asylian lands in an effort to gain access to the fertile grounds that the Asylians live on. The protagonist, Rohn, at first despises the attacks from the Mokai, but, soon after being deceived into committing a horrible act against the Mokai people, starts to see things from another perspective. UpdatesWhen update 2.10 was released a patch.The 147 MB patch brings optional analogue support and a target reticule to the experience, allowing players to control their dragon with the analogue sticks rather than the Sixaxis motion control. Some motion control remains, however, as players will still be required to shake the controller for some moves.",,,,,,,,,

Each tank has 4 skills - 3 basic and one ultimatum, having a special power. To strengthen the tank in battle, you can use the equipment. Players can do ""counter-peaks"" - choose the tank, depending on the skills of the rival tank.

1424240,Mineirinho Classic (Miner Ultra Adventures),99,Sinned Games,Sinned Games,0,0,0,"Action, Casual, Indie",English,,," OverviewMineirinho, the game's protagonistMiner Ultra Adventures is a game developed by Old School Blender Addicted to promote Dom Zelittu's Restaurante, a local restaurant in Brazil. The player controls Mineirinho, the restaurant's mascot, through five levels to rescue his restaurant from the hands of evil aliens. The game is developed in Blender Game Engine. It was released in January 27, 2017 and has an extended DLC adventure in May 2017. GameplayMineirinho infiltrates  a castle terrorized by aliens with his mighty hat.Miner Ultra Adventure requires the player to reach the goal of every stage to advance to the next. After passing through four stages, the player will have to defeat the final boss, which is a giant alien. The game utilizes two buttons and can only be controlled with a keyboard. Pressing Z will let Mineirinho jump. Mineirinho can jump to a total of two times. Pressing X will make Mineirinho use the weapon he currently has. By default, he throws his hat, which boomerangs back to him. The player can pick up other weapons in the game, which mostly consists of the food offered by Dom Zelittu's Restaurante, such as pizza and burgers. These weapons are usually stronger and offer more range. At the start of each stage, the player begins with five hit points. Players can pick up hearts to restore Mineirinho's health. There is no cap to his health, meaning that his health can go above five hit points. There is no game over screen in the game; the player simply has to restart the level from the beginning after every death. StoryMineirinho blasts the aliens that took control of the Illuminati Pyramid.Mineirinho is disturbed as he realizes that his house is surrounded by aliens. In addition to this, his restaurant has been taken over by these aliens. Mineirinho departs from his house to fight the leader of the alien army. Along the way, he comes across a castle, which was taken over by aliens as well. Mineirinho easily slays the aliens terrorizing the castle's citizens. Mineirinho is then given access to the castle's secret underground path, which connects to a giant slide serving as a shortcut to his restaurant. At the end of the giant slide, he arrives at a wasteland. This wasteland is, once again, taken over by aliens. The aliens here have taken control of the Illuminati Pyramid, which is an uncanny symbolization of fast food restaurants' power over the restaurant business. Unfortunately, inside this pyramid is the path Mineirinho must take to reach his restaurant. Mineirinho successfully slays the aliens controlling the pyramid by launching a missile towards it. After taking the path within the pyramid, he realizes he was still deep underground, meaning that he must go up to the surface to reach his restaurant. Fortunately, with the help of a beanstalk, he was able to reach high up into the skies and finally arrive at his restaurant. At his arrival, he is welcomed to a fight against the giant alien leader. To combat the leader with his immense size, Mineirinho utilizes the cannons stored within his restaurant and blasts the leader. With the leader defeated, the aliens have left the earth and Mineirinho is finally able to enjoy the delight of his customers returning to his restaurant.",,,,,,,,,

1424070,Blocks Stacking,99,Miroslav Bago,Miroslav Bago,0,0,0,Casual,English,,,"OverviewStacking is an open-world third person adventure/puzzle game that bases its mechanics around the concept of Russian Matryoshka, or nesting dolls. It is created by Lee Petty, the art director of BrÃ¼tal Legend, and his team at Double Fine. It was released for the PlayStation Network on February 8, 2011 for $14.99 and a day later on Xbox Live Arcade for 1200 Microsoft points. The game was also free on the PS3 for members of the PlayStation Plus program. A PC version, available via Steam, was released on March 6, 2012.StoryIn Stacking, you play as a young chimney sweep named Charlie Blackmore, who also happens to be the world's smallest Matryoshka doll. After his father is hired by a mysterious industrial magnate known only as The Baron and subsequently disappears, Charlie's siblings are forced into hard labor to pay the family's debts. Charlie sets out on a quest to find and reunite his family and subsequently put an end to the horrible child labor laws put forth by The Baron.GameplayCharlie Blackmore, the protagonist.The core gameplay of Stacking is focused around stacking different nesting dolls around you. When you sneak up on another doll and jump inside them, you gain access to that doll's specific ability, which may have an effect like seducing guards and luring them away from their posts or dispersing crowds that impede your progress. There are many unique named dolls around, each with their own unique abilities. These are not only collectibles that tie into achievements/trophies, but crucial to completing certain puzzles.The only rule, other than the fact that you cannot enter a doll that is facing you, is that you can only stack inside dolls that are one size larger than you. Since Charlie is the smallest Matryoshka in this universe, you start off with endless possibilities. As long as you find larger dolls, you can always keep stacking them, but you only have access to the special ability of the outermost persona.Stacking in progress.In contrast with older, typical puzzle-oriented adventure games, Stacking offers several different solutions to each problem you encounter, and you will be encouraged to try out various tactics as you make your way through this stacking adventure. Achievements and trophies are awarded for finding all solutions to a given puzzle.In addition to finding all the solutions for the story progressing puzzles, there are numerous side tasks called ""Hi-Jinks."" Hi-Jinks usually entail using one of the dolls' unique abilities to complete a task. These tasks may include: dressing up, drawing on, or otherwise performing a myriad of actions on the other dolls in the world. Completing a Hi-Jink gives the doll you used (and all similar dolls) a special gold item. These items are only cosmetic and do not affect gameplay in any way. There are a number of unique Hi-Jinks per level and completing all of them in any given level will unlock a trophy or 10-point achievement. Furthermore each world in the game has a number of unique dolls that are not found anywhere else and the game tracks how many you've found.Game WorldThere are four distinct ""levels"" in Stacking, The Royal Train Station,The Gilded Steamship, The Zeppelin of Consequence, and The Triple-Decker Tank Engine. Each location has its own variety of Hi-Jinks and unique dolls to collect.The Royal Train StationTrain station platform.The Royal Train Station acts as a hub world for the game, giving the player access to any of the other three worlds at a moments notice. The train station doesn't serve solely as a hub world though, as it offers it's own set of challenges, hi-jinks, and unique dolls that expand as the player progresses through the game and completes the other main areas. Also, there is a secret room in the Station where Charlie's hobo friend Levi will display the collectibles the player finds and maintain mementos of each area's challenges as they are completed.The Gilded SteamshipSafari located on the Gilded Steamship.The Gilded Steamship is a small city in itself when you're a Matryoshka doll. Two of the more unique areas are the Seaside Safari and the Museum. The ship also features many different side challenges in addition to the main challenge of getting the Great Adventurers aboard the ship to insist together that the Captain stop the ship so that Charlie can save one of his lost siblings.The Zeppelin of ConsequenceThe race tracks aboard the Zeppelin of Consequence.The Zeppelin of Consequence is the location for an important summit meeting debating whether to ban child labor or not. It is up to Charlie to save the imprisoned ambassadors locked away on the zeppelin and get them to unite and vote against child labors, so he can save yet another one of his siblings. The zeppelin itself is actually made up of two separate zeppelins connected together via a zip-line, and offers a few unique areas, such as a large ballroom and a race track.The Triple-Decker Tank EngineInside one of the Triple-Decker cars.The Triple-Decker Tank Engine is a huge coal train where The Baron is hosting a party for rich industrialists hoping to escape the recent child labor ban. Charlie must board the train, evade the guards and outsmart The Baronâs top generals in order to rescue his entire family once and for all. The most notable location inside the train is the huge concert hall, where a group of maestros play pianos of all sizes, and orphaned children serve money to guests.DLCThe Lost Hobo KingThe Lost Hobo King was released April 2011 and features a whole new location for Charlie to explore, filled with all new Hi-Jinks and unique dolls. This time, Charlie travels to the land of Camelfoot to help his friend Levi the Hobo with an important family matter. Levi's uncle is the heir in waiting to the Hobo Kingdom; however, he cannot be appointed King of the Hobos without a crown. Charlie must undertake three tasks to release the captive Hobo Blacksmiths who will then remake the lost Hobo crown.PC System RequirementsMinimumOS: Windows XP SP3Processor: 1.8 GHz dual core CPUMemory: 1 GB RAMGraphics: 256 MB GeForce 8800, Radeon 3850, or Intel HD 2000 GraphicsDirectXÂ®:9.0cHard Drive: 1.5 GB free HD SpaceSound:DirectX Compatible Sound CardRecommendedOS:Windows 7Processor:Intel Core 2 Duo at 2.2 GHz, or AMD Athlon 64 at 2.2 GHzMemory:1 GB RAMGraphics: 512 MB GeForce 220, Radeon 4550, Intel HD 3000 GraphicsDirectXÂ®:9.0cHard Drive: 1.5 GB free HD SpaceSound:DirectX Compatible Sound Card",,,,,,,,,

The game features a large variety of different systems: combat, research, building, ship designs, and other areas.Unlike most 4X games, DW has many automation options, almost allowing the game to play itself save for decision making and diplomacy. This allows the player to learn the games different systems individually, easing the steep learning curve. The player can choose to control (or automate) ship building, ship design, diplomacy, military actions, trade, colonisation and research.DW also separates empire management between the State and Private sectors. State sector objects include military ships, fleets and planets and Private sector ships include trade station, and freight ships. The Private sector is completely automated.The player can achieve victory in many ways. Aside from basic 4x objectives (such as controlling a large percentage of the map, or having a set percentage of the galaxy's population/trade/research) each race has a race specific objective that allows them to strive for the completion of a task that best suits the strengths of their chosen species.Like the Civilization series the game has an in-game editor, which can be switched to at any time, as well as a Galacticopedia, featuring a deep set of tutorials and explanations for the game mechanics, and almost everything present in the game, such as planet types, weaponry and government types.The game is 2D top-down, and uses a mix of sprites and vector/drawn art. It is highly moddable, using .txt and .jpgs for much of the game. ExpansionsDW has 4 expansions so far:Return of the Shakturi (16 Dec 2010) - which added new ship types, redid the tech system and adding more techs, it improved the UI and Fleet system, and added in windowed support along with other minor tweaks.Legends (23 Nov 2011) - which improved how characters (Admirals, Generals, Agents, Etc.) worked and improved the AI, Diplomacy and Fleet systems; it also increased support for modding the game and added more to the tech tree.Shadows (23 May 2013) - this added in the ability to play as Pirates, added in an alternate start time when empires are weaker, and improved AI, game performance, the graphics engine, and in general extended and improved the Ground combat and tech tree for it.Universe (23 May 2014) - the latest expansion, which also includes the base game and all previous expansions added modding and customization support along with a new official storyline. It also marked the first time the game was available on Steam and saw the game receive a significant price deduction. Significant effort went into expanding to modding capabilities of the game engine. The game comes with example mods that can be activated and deactivated at any time. GameplayThe game plays like most 4X games: a main view where you look and keep track of your empire with it, the mini-map and a list, with Research and Management opening in pop-up/separate windows.Starting a new game is more in-depth than most other 4X's, with the player being able to define Galaxy Age, Pirate Intensity and other specific options; this also includes defining how victory can be achieved, with the percentage of the basic objectives (% of Galaxy controlled,% of total Trade controlled and others) needed, as well as percentage of the Race-specific objectives needed. State and Private EmpireThis is where DW simplifies expanding the infrastructure of your empire: instead of manually setting orders to direct trade at this system, a group of private traders will go and automatically trade what they can, instead of having to transport people or goods, private ships will do so automatically.The main difference between the two is that the Private side purchases ships and designs from the State, who run colonies, military vessels, and space bases; the Private side can also build extractors and refineries of their own, running goods transports for the State anyway.Automation options also allows for the State side to be run automatically. Empire ManagementMuch like other 4X games the game allows the player to get a simple look at how his empire is doing through a basic management screen, with options for detailed explanations. ResearchDivided into 3 separate sectors: Weapons tech, Defensive tech and General Empire Tech; each sector researches an item at once, with the tech tree being much like Galactic Civilizations II in terms of layout. Ship DesignDifferent to other space 4X's this works by choosing the ship role, the ship image used, and then picking the components in it, with no need to worry over tile placement, instead having to consider mass, energy power and the limits of what the ship can do.As part of the automation options, the player can set the game to take control over ship design entirely, or take over retrofitting and upgrading, or take control of specific ship designs. Space and Planet CombatSpace combat is very simple in that it has ships fire their weapons and does a runthrough of checks and equations to see how much damage has been done.Planet combat is different to other games in that the defenders must have brought or trained troops of their own to defend a colony, save for the militia, and the attackers bring their troops, leading to a smashing of the two forces to see who wins. Other forms of planetary combat include attacking with ship weaponry, as well as the standard nuking being an option.

Like its primary competitor WarGaming.net, War Thunder offers all three major types of warfare (aerial, naval, ground), but does this in one single game and allows to control jets, helicopters and modern tanks as well. Players controlling air and ground or air and naval forces fight on the same battlegrounds.Aerial CombatThe aerial portion of War Thunder was originally called World of Planes. The name was changed due to perceived confusion with WarGaming.net's World of Warplanes. It features period accurate planes and locations from 1939 to the late XX century. Many historical battles from the second world war and the Korean war are represented as maps.There are multiple difficulty modes depending upon how much realism you desire. Arcade mode is essentially a more simplistic multiplayer shooter while historical battles mode will require more advanced techniques like taking off and landing during battles and realistic damage modelling.There are five countries represented in War Thunder; United States, United Kingdom, Soviet Union, Japan, and Germany. There are two more planned countries which have yet to be included in the game; Australia and Italy. Each have their own unlock trees and sets of planes. As one is levelled, that progress is not transferred to the others. Within each nationality the player has a hangar holding 3-7 planes of their own with many levelling and customisation options. Researching planes and upgrading crews use a mixture of various currencies; some earned in gameplay, some purchased with money.AlphaThe War Thunder aerial alpha ran from October 2011 to March 2012.BetaCrashing without a tail in the beta.The closed beta began in March 2012 and concluded in October 2012. On Nov. 1, 2012 the game entered open beta. Gaijin Entertainment has stated the stats and progression earned by players during the open beta will not be reset when the game goes into full release. Purchasable upgrades and currency were also live as of the open beta. The game is downloaded via Gaijin's website as a free client, but on Feb. 26, 2013 the game passed Steam Greenlight and is due for release in the coming months.AircraftHere is a list of currently available and planned aircraft as of the beta release.

The decision to focues on small water navies instead of full-blown capital ships was made because the developers found it hard to make the latter fit within the game; a realistic approach resulted in matches taking far too long, but speeding the ships up made it too arcade-y and unrealistic.Naval combat were first announced on the 12th of August 2016 along with two premium vehicle pre-order packs that included access to closed bre-beta testing. It was also announced that unlike ground forces, naval combat would launch with all five nations at the same time. The first closed pre-beta test was held on the 2nd of December 2016, with another following a few days later.Ground CombatThe first three countries that will have playable ground vehicles are United States, Germany and the Soviet Union.

Similar to the original game, players must uncover tiles on a tiled board while avoiding hidden landmines (whose locations are deduced by the player, as uncovered tiles show how many mines surround it).Similar to the studio's adaptation of Sudoku, Minesweeper adds a variety of new features to the original, including Xbox Live support (with leaderboards and achievements), a persistent XP system, with unlockable power-ups, and an alternate game mode (""Speed"", which involves a countdown timer).

1422050,UOS Prototype,0,ultranet.org,ultranet.org,0,0,1,Early Access,English,,,"OverviewManhattan is your playground.Developed by Radical Entertainment and published by Sierra Entertainment and Activision, Prototype is an action game with a sandbox style of gameplay similar to Grand Theft Auto and Spider-Man. Set on Manhattan Island, players take control of protagonist Alex Mercer, a man with a mysterious past whose true nature is revealed through the course of the game. By performing various tasks in the game world, from story-driven quests to causing random destruction, players earn ""evolution points"" which may be spent on new abilities. These abilities range from simple stat upgrades to access to new shapeshifting forms.SynopsisA Shapeshifting WeaponThe game opens with Alex Mercer awaking in a morgue, the doctors having believed him dead. Struggling against a painful case of amnesia, Mercer escapes the morgue in search of his sister, Dana. Working with his sister and other allies, Alex seeks to uncover his powers' origins as well as stop a mysterious viral outbreak that has also appeared on the island.Unfortunately, Mercer is hindered by the United States military as well as the merciless Blackwatch. These black ops soldiers will stop at nothing to contain the virus and capture Mercer, even if it means destroying everyone and everything in their path. With martial law declared and an iron blockade isolating Manhattan, Alex has no choice but to confront both the viral monsters and the military forces at every turn, all the while uncovering the terrible secrets concerning the nature of the virus and the nature of his powers.GameplayTanks? No problem.Prototype iterates heavily on Radical Entertainment's 2005 superhero game, The Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction, with both sharing a focus on chaos and destruction. Locomotion is also similar, with both games' protagonists capable of running along the facades of skyscrapers and leaping hundreds of feet into the air. Augmenting Alex Mercer's superior running and jumping skills is his ability to "" auto parkour"". As long as he is running, obstacles in Alex Mercer's path are automatically leaped and flipped over, providing a single, fluid direction of movement regardless of the path taken.Prototype also introduces new stealth mechanics where players may literally consume other humans and take their form, using the disguise for both evasion and infiltration. The act of consuming another being also replenishes Mercer's biomass, effectively turning any person into a health boost. In certain points in the game, consuming another being does more than just replenish health. Alex Mercer may also absorb the memories, skills, and even the personality of his victim, allowing Mercer to uncover story elements, gain new skills, and improve existing ones.PowersCombine the blade and armor powers.Alex Mercer possesses a wide variety of abilities, many of which require manual activation by the player. These active powers are separated into categories. At any one time, Alex may simultaneously equip one offensive, defensive, and visual power. His disguise power, however, may only be simultaneously used with visual powers. Intelligent use of these abilities allows the player to conquer any obstacle the game presents.Miscellaneous PowersConsume - Alex can absorb the biomass of the humans he kills into his body, replenishing his health. Larger, inhuman enemies may also be partially consumed once weakened. Alex can also absorb the memories of some of the people he consumes; consuming specific targets may improve combat skills or provide insight into various story elements, also known as the ""Web of Intrigue"".Regeneration - If Alex is injured and no longer receiving damage, his body will automatically repair itself and slowly regain health.Strength - With superhuman strength, Alex can punch through armoured tanks and hurl the resulting husks at helicopters.Speed - Alex can sprint indefinitely through oncoming traffic and straight up the sides of buildings.Glide - When running isn't the best option, Alex produces invisible filaments extending from his arms and legs, allowing him to glide short distances.Devastator Abilities - By possessing sufficient biomass, Alex may turn his body into a weapon of even greater destruction, hurling his form as ground spikes, airborne tendrils, or a single pillar of death.Offensive PowersClaws - Each of Alex's fingers becomes a vicious claw. Although significantly more powerful than his fists, these weapons are still relatively weak in melee. However, they grant Alex the ability to send his claws underground, erupting violently underneath an opponent.Hammerfists - Alex shifts a great deal of biomass into his hands, transforming them into enormous bludgeons with which he can smash through the protection of armored targets or even turn himself into a human projectile.Whipfist - Alex's right arms transforms into an elastic, whip-like tendril with a terminal hook. The Whipfist is best used on multiple or distant opponents as well as latching onto distant obstacles and pulling them closer. Especially useful is its ability to latch onto helicopters to let Alex get close enough to steal them.Musclemass - Alex focuses his biomass into both his arms, drastically increasing his strength. While he no longer has access to special moves associated with other offensive powers, Alex's traditional combos and thrown objects now deal increased damage.Blade - One of the signature abilities. Alex's right arm transforms into a single elongated blade, deadly against both armoured and unarmoured opponents. Despite its shape, Alex is still able to grab and pick up people with it... somehow.Defensive PowersShield - Alex's left arm grows into a shield which extends to cover his front while he runs or locks onto a target, protecting him from damage. However, it can shatter if given enough punishment. It regenerates over time. It also disables his parkour abilities, in favour of holding the shield in front of him and smashing straight through obstacles.Armour Form - Alex's entire body becomes encased in an incredibly durable armour skin, reducing all received damage. Such increased mass, however, decreases Alex's mobility. He can no longer parkour or glide and his jumping ability is greatly diminished.Sensory PowersThermal Vision - Alex's visual senses attune to the infrared band, allowing him to more easily spot heat signatures through fog and smoke. Drawbacks include reduced visual range and a decrease in auditory feedback.Infected Vision - By connecting his mind to the viral hive mind that guides the infected, Alex sees the world as his enemy sees. Enemies become more brightly illuminated, and line of sight is no longer reduced. Auditory senses, however, are decreased to only a low rumbling at all times.Disguise AbilitiesDisguise - Alex shapeshifts into the form of the last healthy human he consumed (he cannot take the form of the Infected). Doing so has many applications, chiefly evading pursuers and using the shape of military personnel to infiltrate fortified military installations. If no alarm has been raised, Alex may even silently hijack vehicles without breaking cover.Stealth Consume - If no military personnel are watching, Alex may consume and take the form of an individual in one fluid motion without raising an alarm.Patsy - Only available while in military disguise, Alex accuses another soldier of being Alex Mercer, somehow instantly convincing surrounding allies to open fire on the luckless individual. This initially requires close contact with the victim, but can be upgraded to a simple point.Air Strike - Again only available in military disguise, Alex can radio in air support. Alex can only make so many calls, however, before he must consume a military commander to inexplicably restock the ability's uses.Vehicular SkillsJack Helicopters - Once Alex has consumed a helicopter pilot, he can steal choppers from their pilots by leaping onto them as they are flying through the air. He can then fly around freely and use the copter's full arsenal against his enemies.Jack Armour - Once Alex has consumed a tank driver, he can steal tanks and APCs by jumping onto them, wrenching open the lid and killing everybody inside. After that, he can freely ride around and he obtains full access to the tank's variety of guns and cannons.DevastatorDevastator attacks can only be performed when Alex is in 'Critical Mass'. In order to reach Critical Mass, Alex must consume enough humans or infected to overfill his health bar. The Devastator attack will relieve Alex of this over burden of health, and the results are usually worth it. Each of the devastator attacks has an Air version, purchased separately, that can be executed while jumping or falling.Groundspike Graveyard - A massive area of effect attack of spikes piercing out of the groundTendril Barrage - Alex becomes the center point for a large explosions of tendrils that damage everything they touch.Critical Pain - The only devastator which is a directed attack; appears to be a horizontal tornado coming out of Alex.PC System RequirementsOS: WindowsÂ® XP (with Service Pack 3) or Windows VistaÂ®Processor: IntelÂ® Coreâ¢2 Duo 2.6 GHz or AMD Athlonâ¢ 64 X2 4000 or betterMemory: Vista 2 GB RAM / XP 1 GB RAMGraphics: All NVIDIAÂ® GeForceÂ® 7800 GT 256 MB and better chipsets.

1421480,Mafia: Definitive Edition - Official Score,0,Hangar 13,2K,0,0,0,,,,,"OverviewMafia: Definitive Edition is the most recent game in the Mafia series to date. The game released on September 25th 2020 for PC, Xbox One and PlayStation 4.Mafia: Definitive Edition is a remake of the original Mafia, which originally released in 2002. It also served as the final addition to the Mafia Trilogy, a collection which includes remasters of Mafia II and Mafia III.StoryThe game begins in 1938. Detective Norman arrives at a bar on Central Island to interrogate Thomas Angelo, a former capo in the Salieri crime family who has been marked for death. Tommy agrees to disclose his history with Don Salieri, as well as some information, in return for the protection of him and his family.Prior to having any involvement with organized crime, Tommy was a taxi cab driver during the early years of the Great Depression. Although the hours were long and the pay was low, Tommy was grateful to be employed during a time of financial crisis where many people were suffering. One night in 1930, while Tommy was on his shift, he witnesses a car shootout between gangsters of two rival families: Salieri and Morello. Two of Salieri's trusted men called Paulie & Sam hold Tommy at gunpoint and order him to evade the pursuing cars. After Tommy successfully escapes from the prevalent gang war, Sam tells Tommy to head to Little Italy. Paulie and Sam head into Salieri's bar, and Sam returns to give Tommy money to compensate for the damage done to his car. Soon afterwards, Tommy realizes that he's been paid much more than he expected and begins to take an interest to the criminal lifestyle.The following day, Tommy takes on various taxi fares across the city. Whilst on break, Tommy is attacked by two of Morello's men who tracked him down. Tommy breaks free from their grasp and a chase ensues. Making his way towards Salieri's bar, Tommy regroups with Paulie and Sam, who threaten Morello's thugs to leave. Shortly afterwards, Sam decides to introduce Tommy to Don Salieri.During a sit down, Salieri offers to give Tommy a loan which will cover the damages done to his taxi cab. While Tommy is thankful for this offer, he makes it clear that he wants to get revenge on the men who attacked him. With Paulie's help, Salieri allows Tommy to smash up some of the cars parked in the garage of Morello's bar. Afterwards, Paulie introduces Tommy to Ralph - the mechanic and locksmith of the Salieri family with a noticeable stutter, and Vincenzo - Salieri's gunsmith who like to  show-off. ",,,,,,,,,

Throughout the game, players can collect several items; color-coded keys, swords that defeat skulls, scepters that grant temporary invincibility, and torches that light up dark levels.Levels are sometimes variations on previous levels. For instance, Level 3 is very similar to Level 1, except with a couple of minor changes that make the level more challenging.On dark levels, none of the platforms ladders or chains are visible until the player finds a torch. This requires blind exploration, based on the general layout of previous levels, before locating the torch and revealing the platforms for the rest of the level. However, the last level of the game is entirely dark and no torches are available.Between levels, the player falls through areas populated only by gold bars and chains. The player needs to grab the chain before the end of the bonus area to land safely at the beginning of the next level. ",,,,,,,,,

As players progress, stages become harder and more complex and allow the player to unlock power-ups, throwables, and obstacles to be used during other modes of play.Playground Mode allows players to create their own layouts and try to shoot them.

1420630,Edge of Elsewhere,0,Super63,Super63,0,0,0,"Casual, Indie, RPG, Simulation",English,,,"OverviewEDGE (known as ""EDGY"" in the US) was, and still is, one of the most controversial titles on the iTunes App Store. This is not due to adult content, or anything within the game itself, but rather to the use of the word ""EDGE"" as the title. The game itself has won countless awards for almost every aspect of the game, including the prestigious Milthon award for Best Mobile Game in Paris, and the IMGA (International Mobile Game Award) at the mobile world congress in Barcelona.GameplayEDGE is a platforming game with grid-based movement. You control a cube which must make it to the exit of each level while collecting smaller, colorful cubes called ""prisms"". Collecting prisms increases the movement speed of your cube. Scoring is based on the time to complete an individual level as well as the percentage of prisms collected. Like many other games, EDGE makes use of an S-Rank if you perform flawlessly in a level.Final releases of the game came with over 40 levels, as well as unlockable levels upon collecting all the cubes in each of the main levels. Some of the levels imitate light themes from classic games, or make use of optical illusions to twist the players perception (as the camera is isometric and not directly controlled by the player). There are no enemies in the game but levels commonly include dynamic elements such as buttons, moving tiles or obstacles which may cause an unwary player to fall off the edge of the level. Doing so results in a restart from various invisible check points. Time continues during and after death, making a perfect playthrough the best way to complete a level for S-Rank. There are also more advanced techniques such as balancing the cube halfway to 'hang' on an edge, or using special tiles to shrink your cube and allow it to climb vertical surfaces or fit through smaller areas.You control the cube on the iPhone by swiping and holding your finger in the direction you want it to move, anywhere on the screen. EDGE was the very first game on the App Store to implement this type of touch control. The PC version can be controlled with a keyboard or controller, which can cause confusion as the cube moves diagonally relative to the keys pressed.ControversyLegal IssuesOn April 7th, 2009, the founder of Mobigame, David Papazian, received an email from Apple stating that his game had been reported as infringing on a copyright for the word ""Edge"", and that it would be removed from the App Store. Soon after, he send the owner of the trademark for ""EDGE"", Tim Langdel an email, hoping to work out the issue personally. The following are excerpts of the two initial emails, quoted from an in-depth article posted by Eurogamer on August 3, 2009.""We chose the name Edge because it reflects the game's style: the cube you navigate through levels is always hanging on the edge. I did not know about your company or your games before. Please believe me that we did not intend to pass our game off as one of yours in any way.""Tim Langdel replied with the following:""I am a strong supporter of innovation in games... It is not our intention to do anything other than encourage originality in games and to encourage new game makers. But the problem is that using the trademark 'EDGE' for a game is a direct infringement of our international rights. We have spent a lot of time (and a large amount of money) stopping everyone who tries to use the mark EDGE [for a] game. You wouldn't think of using 'Activision' as the name of a game would you? Even though there has never been a game called Activision. Or 'Electronic Arts' or 'Nintendo'? No, all these names are so closely associated with the name of the company, you would not be permitted to use them for a game without the express permission of the trademark owner... It is the same with EDGE.""These emails sparked what has become one of the most publicized legal battles involving an independent game developer in recent history. On one side of the fence, Langdell claims that he has full rights to using the word ""EDGE"" in any game setting, and that the game itself is very similar to his 1986 title ""Bobby Bearing"". He stated that he offered that Mobigame simply change the name to ""EDGY"", but registered the US trademark for ""EDGY"" soon after making the suggestion.According to David, he had tried to work with Tim through multiple emails, but essentially was unable to reach an agreement on the trademark infringement. Both parties have reported conflicting stories as to what actually took place, and evidence supporting both sides has gone public in various forms; generally email communications.Public OpinionWhile the legal battle between Mobigame and Edge Games has been going for quite some time, no verdict has been reached on the matter. However, public opinion on the matter has been overwhelmingly on the side of David Papazian. This could be due to Mobigame being the ""underdog"" in this matter; the independent studio going up against an established company. However, several popular gaming news sites who reported on the events, such as Kotaku and Eurogamer, mentioned numerous cases in the past where Langdell had aggressively sought out legal action against other developers who tried to use the word ""edge"" in their game title or other platforms. This includes major publisher Namco, who was planning on releasing their game, Soul Edge, in the US at the time. Namco ended up changing the name of the game to ""Soul Blade"" in the US to avoid complications.Multiple Apps Store ReleasesDuring the period of legal actions from and against Mobigame, EDGE has been released and removed several times on the App Store. The game was released in December, 2008, but was pulled several months later in May 2009 after Apple received the warning about the copyright violations. After no settlement was made between Mobigame and Edge Games, EDGE was approved by Apple and returned to the app store on October 7, 2009 as ""Edge by Mobigame"". Despite the change in name, the game was pulled again just a few weeks later on November 26th.Mobigame then released the game a 3rd time under the name ""EDGY"" a few days later on December 1. Soon after, it was pulled again, this time by Mobigame, who was worried the release would be used in Langdell's case against EA. Currently, EDGE/EDGY cannot be found in the US or UK App stores, but is still available in other countries. The only game currently available by Mobigame in the US and UK is Cross Fingers.EA's InvolvementIn September of 2009, Electronic Arts Entertainment filed a Petition for Cancellation against several ""Edge"" trademarks. EA states that the word ""Edge"" has not actively been used in any recent commerce from the company. This came a few months after Langdell had threatened legal action against EA for using the same word in their ""Mirror's Edge"" series of games.As of March, 2010, reports from Edge Games, Langdell's game company, state that they are ""completely confident"" they will win the legal battles with both Mobigame and EA. Below is an excerpt from a press release by Edge Games concerning the matter:""Bottom line, we are the oldest remaining British game company, and one of the oldest remaining US game companies doesn't like the fact there is still one UK company older than itself that they have not yet destroyed. And they wont succeed. False rumours, misinformation and defamation never won any trademark case and it wont this time, either.IGDA InvolvementTim Langdell was inducted onto the board at the International Game Developers Association in March of 2009. After the events and accusations of Langdell's alleged involvement in ""trademark trolling"" smaller independent developers, including Mobigame, an internal petition to members of the IGDA called for a vote to remove him. While the IGDA did not directly start the petition, a meeting was called for October, 3, 2009 to consider the action. Tim resigned from the board in August, 2009.ResolutionOn April 17th, 2013, the legal battle finally reached a conclusion when a California judge formally cancelled Langdell's ownership of the trademark after all legal hurdles in the way of EA's petition for cancellation originally filed in 2009 had been cleared.System RequirementsPC RequirementsMinimum:OS:Windows XPProcessor:Intel Pentium 4 / AMD Athlon XP 1.5 Ghz or higherMemory:512 MB RAMGraphics:DirectX 9 compatible, 64MB VRAMDirectXÂ®:dx90cHard Drive:100 MB HD spaceRecommended:Memory:1 GB RAMDirectXÂ®:dx90cMac RequirementsMinimum:OS:OS X 10.5 (Leopard)Processor:IntelMemory:512 MB RAMHard Drive:100 MB HD spaceRecommended:Memory:1 GB RAM",,,,,,,,,

It is a unique entry to the series due to it being a vertical danmaku photography game.PlotThroughout Shoot the Bullet, players take control of Aya Shameimaru as she takes photographs of characters from various games in the series. However, the purpose of these photographs is never revealed, and it is even pointed out that ""No one knows the purpose of the photos, except Aya,"" and the reason for her not attacking her opponents is ""not to be nice, but because she doesn't want her bullets in the picture.""GameplayIn Shoot the Bullet, rather than shooting projectiles at the enemy, the main goal is to take a certain number of photographs of each boss' bullet patterns, thus defeating them.There is only one difficulty level present in Shoot the Bullet, equivalent to that of the Lunatic (highest) difficulty present in the other games in the series.Working that CameraIn order to take a picture, Aya's camera must be charged to 100%, which the player will be notified of through means of a sound, as well as the text ""100%"" and ""Enabled"" which will appear around the crosshairs near her. At the beginning of each stage, the camera's charge will be at around 50-70%. The camera slowly charges up by itself, and the player can increase the speed of charge through holding down both the focus and shoot buttons, however, this causes Aya's speed to greatly decrease. Note that this prevents the player from taking any pictures whilst in focus mode.Controlling the crosshairs to take a picture of a distant areaSnapping those PicturesThe on-screen crosshairs are used to dictate the center of the planned picture. These crosshairs will normally stay near Aya, pointing in the direction of the boss, although during focus mode, they will move slightly closer toward the boss and, if close enough, will stick on top of said boss.The crosshairs may be moved when the camera is fully charged through holding down the shoot button and using the directional pad to control it, enabling the player to take pictures at further distances at the expense of picture size. Whilst doing so, time slows down dramatically and, after a certain period of time, Aya is forced to discard the shot as the picture frame becomes too small, draining the camera to 50%If a picture includes the boss, it is regarded as a success and shown on the side of the screen. A picture which does not include the boss is deemed a failure and discarded.Whenever a picture is taken, regardless of it being a success of failure, the camera is drained to 0%. However, bullets and other obstacles (such as mist) caught in the picture will disappear and restore a tiny amount of charge each. However, the camera can only regain a maximum of 30% charge from a successful shot and 60% from an unsuccessful one.StagesShoot the Bullet features ten stages, as well as an extra (EX) stage. Each stage has a varied number of scenes, any of which can be selected once the stage has been unlocked, though the game will only recognise the existance of the stage above the player's current highest open stage (i.e: If the player has stage 3 unlocked, attempting to view stage 4 will only show its unlock requirements, whilst stages 5-10 will not appear at all).Unlocking StagesTo unlock any non-EX stage, the player can either:clear three scenes in the stage before, orclear a certain number of total scenesA stage is considered clear when the player takes a specified number of pictures of the enemy boss within a certain time limit, without being killed. A cleared scene can be identified through the character ""æ¸"" beside the scene label.Aya may complain about the quality of the pictures taken if the player's highest score for a scene is not high enough. Cleared scenes with a sufficient high-score will have their text which gives Aya's opinion of the bullet patterns (present at the bottom of the screen) in light-red instead of blue.The total photo count and best photo for each scene are updated regardless of whether or not the scene was cleared or failed, whilst the high-score is not, which can lead to single photo scores having a higher value than the highest total score for a scene.CharactersThroughout Shoot the Bullet, the player can only take control of Aya Shameimaru, however, the game's bosses are characters present from The Embodiment of Scarlet Devil through Phantasmagoria of Flower View.Stage 1No preconditions required to unlock:åãè²ã®å¤§ç¾¤ (Swarm of Bright Bugs) Wriggle Nightbugæéã«æ½ãå¦æª (Youkai Hiding in the Darkness) RumiaStage 2Unlocked after clearing 3 scenes in stage 1: ä¸èªç¶ãªå·æ° (Unnatural Chill) Cirno å±æçãªå¤§å¯æ³¢ (Localized Cold Wave) Letty Whiterock Stage 3Unlocked after clearing 3 scenes in stage 2, or clearing 8 stages in total: è¦ãç®ã ãè³ãããªå¦æª (Superficially Busy Youkai) Alice Margatroid è³¢è¦ããæ­´å²å®¶ (Bookish Historian) Keine Kamishirasawa Stage 4Unlocked after clearing 3 scenes in stage 3, or clearing 14 stages in total: è¦çãæºãã¶ãå¦æªå (Sight-Shaking Youkai Rabbit) Reisen Udongein Inaba ä½ã«åªãããªãäººå½¢ (Poison Doll) Medicine Melancholy é£ã³è·³ã­ãåã®å¤§ç¾¤ (Herd of Leaping Rabbits) Tewi InabaStage 5Unlocked after clearing 3 scenes in stage 4, or clearing 20 stages in total:è²é®®ããã«è¹è²ãªéçª (Colorful Rainbow Gatekeeper) Hong Meirin å¾ä½ã®ç¥ããªãé­æ³ã®å (Enigmatic Source of Magic) Patchouli Knowledge Stage 6Unlocked after clearing 3 scenes in stage 5, or clearing 25 stages in total: ç®ã«ãçã¾ããªãåç« (Hyperactive Monster Cat) Chen æ¬ãæ¨ã¦å¾¡å (Kirisute Gomen) Youmu Konpaku Stage 7Unlocked after clearing 3 scenes in stage 6, or clearing 30 stages in total: å±éºãªæåå¸« (Dangerous Illusionist) Sakuya Izayoi ç´è²ã®ä¸ç (World of Crimson) Remilia Scarlet Stage 8Unlocked after clearing 3 scenes in stage 7, or clearing 35 stages in total:çããåç© (Unusual Animal) Ran Yakumo å¹½éãªå¿éåç (Elegant Ghost Photography) Yuyuko Saigyouji Stage 9Unlocked after clearing 3 scenes in stage 8, or clearing 40 stages in total:è¡ã®è¬å±ãã (Town Pharmacist) Eirin Yagokoro äººéããããªããå§«æ§ (Inhuman Princess) Kaguya Houraisan Stage 10Unlocked after clearing 3 scenes in stage 9, or clearing 45 stages in total:æ±æ¸ã£å­æ°è³ªãªæ­»ç¥ (Edokko God of Death) Komachi Onozuka å£ããããæé£ããè©± (Nagging Helpful Lecture) Sikieiki Yamaxanadu Stage EXUnlocked after clearing 66 stages in total:æãããæ³¢å (Diabolic Wave) Flandre Scarlet æ°å³ã®æªãå¾®ç¬ã¿ (Uncanny Smile) Yukari Yakumo ç¼æ­»ããªãäººé (Human Immune to Death by Fire) Fujiwara no Mokou å¤ªå¤ã®æä»£ (The Dawn of Time) Suika Ibuki ScoringScoring in Shoot the Bullet depends on a number of factors:Bullet FactorsThe base score is awarded depending on the number of bullets and other objects in each picture. Other objects are things such as Alice's dolls and Letty's mist.The larger a bullet is, the more points that will be awarded for it. The same applies to a bullet's velocity: the faster it is, the more points that are awarded. However, a bullet can also be worth zero points whenever the player is up against Reisen, as it is possible to take a picture whilst she is ""phasing"" them around.Boss ShotMultiplier: 1.2x - 2.0xAwarded whenever the boss is in the picture. The multiplier increases as the crosshairs approach the boss, with the 2.0x awarded when the boss becomes the centre of them.Self ShotMultiplier: 1.2xAwarded when Aya herself appears in the picture.Two ShotThe spell circle surrounding Fujiwara no MokouMultiplier: 1.5xAwarded when both Aya and the boss are present in the picture.Nice ShotMultiplier: 1.2 - 1.5xAwarded when the spell circle of a boss is in the picture. The spell circle is a red hexagram that is surrounded by two circles, which appears at set times during a boss' attack pattern. It starts off large and is centred on the boss, however, it quickly shrinks and disappears. The larger the spell circle in the picture, the larger the multiplier bonus.Risk ShotAdds 300 - 2,000 pointsSmall bullets: x100 pointsMiddle bullets: x400 pointsBig bullets: x1,000 pointsLaser: x200 pointsRewarded when Aya is close to a bullet when the picture is taken. The number of points given varies with the number of bullets/strength of lasers and the kind of bullets. If the total is less than 300, the bonus is revoked, and if greater than 2,000, it is rounded back down to 2,000.(colour) ShotAn example of a Colourful ShotAdds 300 pointsAwarded when there is a large number of a specific bullet colour. It is possible to gain two or more of these bonuses at a time.Colourful ShotAdds 900 pointsAwarded when there is a large variation of bullet colours.Rainbow ShotAdds 2,100 pointsAwarded when there is a very large variation of bullet colours.Solo ShotAdds 100 pointsAwarded when only the boss or Aya appears in the picture.Empty ShotNo bonus pointsAwarded when the picture is empty. Appears as just a message, awarding no bonus points.DevelopmentAfter recognizing that all of the past games in the Touhou Project were inspired by arcade games, ZUN, the sole member of Team Shanghai Alice, decided to make an experimental game which would remove any and all arcade conventions.The cover of Bohemian Archive in Japanese RedThe concept of a danmaku photography game first struck ZUN during the production of The Embodiment of Scarlet Devil whilst he was in the midst of creating Spell Cards, realizing that taking snapshots of danmaku patterns was rather fun, and that it would make for an entertaining game. After completing The Embodiment of Scarlet Devil, he attempted to create a new weapon for Reimu Hakurei which would incorporate this idea, allowing for her to take pictures in order to seal away bullets, however, he felt that this was an unnatural addition to the series at the time as none of the characters had any reason to take pictures, causing him to abandon the idea for two years until after Imperishable Night was released.ZUN decided that he must create a character who had a reason to take pictures in order to implement this idea naturally, which lead to the creation of Aya Shameimaru, who was to be introduced in Phantasmagoria of Flower View so that her appearance as a main character in the planned photography game would not be too abrupt. At the same time, Ichijinsha, a mange publisher, was planning on creating a manga anthology of the Touhou Project, however, ZUN saw this as an opportunity to introduce Aya, and thus he negotiated with Ichijinsha in order to turn the anthology into a fanbook which would contain interviews and samples from Aya's newspaper. The final result of these negotiations was Touhou Bunkachou ~ Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red, which was released three days before Phantasmagoria of Flower View. At first, ZUN had planned on releasing Shoot the Bullet alongside the fanbook, however, he lacked the time in order to do so, yet he continued to use the name ""Touhou Bunkachou"" without Ichijinsha's per The development of Shoot the Bullet took a month and a half to complete, with it finally being released on the 30th of December, 2005.Post-ReleaseWith the arrival of the version 1.01a patch on the 9th of January, 2006, ZUN added in an empty stage entitled ""Gogai,"" after stage EX, promising that he would add in playable scenes at a later time. However, on the 16th of October, 2006, ZUN announced that he would not produce the ""Gogai"" scenes as he did not have the time and that he would rather begin work on new projects, leaving Shoot the Bullet with an empty and useless stage.Shoot the Bullet was also used a type of game engine on which two of ZUN's future games, Mountain of Faith and Drinking Party, were based on.MusicThe translated name of each theme is provided below the original version:- Title and Menu themeå¤©çã®æå¸ãï½ Mysterious NoteTengu's Notebook ~ Mysterious NoteZUN note:The same old piece.However, this time I tried to give it a bit more of adark and retro feel, as well as a bit of youkai.That raining noise is a youkai mystery.

It is similar to  Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream in that it is also a versus-styled shooter where  the player indirectly combats another character through charging and releasing Spell Cards. PlotSpring has come once again, and the flowers are blooming as per usual. Or at least, that's how it seems. This time around, there are far more than normal, and even flowers which do not bloom in Spring are blooming. After noticing the thick covering of flowers all over Gensokyo, (most of) the heroines decide that something must be up, and so they head out in search of answers.It doesn't take much time for each of them to bump into one another, all of them demanding answers from whomever they meet, but to no avail. It's not until they reach  Komachi, the primary cause for everything that happened, after stumbling across the  higanbana field where she is resting that they learn that the flowers are possessed by ghosts which are waiting to be ferried across to Higan (the plane where they are judged by the  Enma) by Komachi, who had been neglecting her duties. They also learn that a similar event happened in 1945 (around 60 years ago, during World War II) due to the large number of souls which had to be ferried to Higan, once again due to Komachi's slacking.After a battle between Komachi and whoever the player selected,  Sikieiki, who is Komachi's boss and the Judge of the Dead, shows up to give Komachi an earful due to her slacking. However, she also takes this oppotunity to lecture the selected heroine on her various faults, which ends up in a battle between them so that Sikieiki can prove her point.  GameplayPhantasmagoria of Flower View is a competitive vertically  scrolling Danmaku shooter, where two players engage in a toned down style of  Danmaku gameplay on a split-screen. After certain conditions are met, both  players will be able to release a variety of Spell Attacks based on which  character they are using in an attempt to reduce the remaining health of their  opponent.There are four difficulties: Easy, Normal, Hard and Lunatic.  Each difficulty affects the number and speed of base bullets that appear  onscreen, as well as the difficulty of AI opponents. Additionally, each  difficulty has a specific initial Spell Attack level.In Story Mode, the  player faces off against 9 AI opponents, each one more difficult than the last.  The game also features a Match Mode where the player can face off against  individual AI opponents or real-life players, as well as watch AI vs AI  matches. There is also a  netplay patch, which makes multiplayer possible through LAN or the internet. Defeating Enemies and Damaging OpponentsIn Phantasmagoria of Flower View, the player must defeat onscreen enemies in order to build up Spell  Attacks to damage an opponent. Enemies and opponents can be defeated through the  use of the following abilities: ShotThe shot is the basic way of attacking enemies. The shot's strength  and area of effect is different depending on which character the player has  chosen. Spell GaugeThe spell gauge is a visual indication of a character's stored magical power, which appears at the bottom of the player's side of the screen. After the gauge fills to certain points, it becomes possible to unleash more powerful attacks, as well as influence the opponent's field. The gauge is divided into four parts, each part being referred to as a level. Destroying enemies fills up the spell gauge  The spell gauge is filled a little by each enemy you defeat. You will gain a larger boost if small white bullets are eliminated from the field after being caught in the explosion from an enemy that has been defeated. Losing health will also grant a boost towards the spell gauge, and if the player happens to be on their last life, a level 4 spell will granted. Level 4 spells can also be obtained by collecting special ""G"" bonuses (see ""Special Bonuses"")  To activate an attack from the spell gauge, the shot key must be held, which will charge the gauge. When the shot key is released, an attack from the spell gauge will be released depending on where the charge indicator was on the gauge at the moment of release. Different characters will charge the gauge at different speeds. The spell gauge can only be charged as high as its current fill level.  Spell Gauge AbilitiesThere are 4 spells available for use:Level 1Unleashes a special attack that is capable of destroying multiple targets at once. Has no direct effect on the opponent.Level 2 - Fairy LevelUnleashes a more powerful version of the special attack and, depending on the character selected, it will surround the opponent with obstacles. It will also remove any bullets in a moderate radius from the player.Â  Decreases the spell gauge by 1 level.Level 3 - Witch LevelDestroys everything within a large radius of the player, and will clutter the opponent's field with obstacles and targets in fixed patterns based on the character selected.Â  Decreases the spell gauge by 2 levels.A boss in action Level 4 - Dragon LevelClears the entirity of the player's field, and a creates a mirror version of the player's character (called a ""Boss"") which appears on the opponent's field to create devastating effects which include combinations of level 2 and 3 spells and some unique attacks, based on the character selected. These Bosses will dissappear from the field once they receieve a specific number of hits based on the number present on the bottom right of the player's field, or if they are not destroyed within a certain amount of time. Decreases the spell gauge by 3 levels.  Additionally, whenever the score counter reaches 100,000 and 300,000, a level 4 spell is unleashed upon the opponent, and when it reaches 500,000, a level 3 and a level4 spell are unleashed at the same time. If an opponent launches a spell (no matter which level), the player will be able to neutralise it through the activation of a level 4 spell and vice-versa, adding a much more tactical approach to the use of spells.  Spell LevelAt the bottom corners of the player's field, the strength of their spells are displayed. The initial spell levels are set depending on which difficulty you have chosen. In story mode, the base spell levels increase by 1 after each round, which can happen until a maximum level of 16 is reached. The number on the left-hand side affects the power of the player's level 2 and 3 spells, and it increases whenever a spell of level 2 or higher is activated. The number on the right-hand side is shared with the opponent, affecting the power and health of the boss that is sent out during a level 4 spell. This number increases whenever a level 4 spell is activated.Stage EnemiesThere are 3 types of stage enemies that will attempt to hinder the player throughout the game:Spirits resemble glowing butterflies FairiesThese come in two sizes - small and large. They are the primary targets in the game, and are incredibly easy to destroy. After destroying one, a small explosion is created which destroys anything within its radius, allowing the player to destroy a whole row of them with just one shot.SpiritsThese are formed whenever the opponent destroys a certain amount of faeries. They vary in speed and size, and they tend to float towards the bottom of the field. They require a bit more firepower to destroy.Activated SpiritsThese are created when spirits come into contact with the player's field (which is created when the focus button is held in). Unlike normal spirits, these drift upwards and have a reduced speed, making them easier to destroy. If they are left undestroyed, however, they will dissolve into 3 white bullets with a red outline that drift towards the last known position of the player's character.Destroying stage enemies may cause them to become level 1 obstacles or EX attacks (see ""Obstacles"") on the opponent's field, and any level 1 obstacle caught in their explosion range will be sent to the opponent's field.ObstaclesObstacles are bullets that appear on the field which can only be destroyed through the use of an appropriate spell (with the exception of level 1 obstacles). The field can become cluttered with many types of bullets Level 1 ObstacleSmall bullets which are either light blue or light red. Light blue bullets are mostly randomly generated, and are aimed in the general direction of the player's character, whereas light red bulletsÂ  tend to appear whenever a spell is used, and travel in random directions. If a level 1 obstacle is caught in the explosion of a stage enemy, it will be reflected onto the opponent's field with the same colour and speed. Level 2 ObstacleImproved versions of level 1 obstacles, they have many different forms.EX Attack ObstaclesBullets which are generated when fairies and/or spirits are destroyed. They fly onto the player's field as glowing patterns, and then spawn wherever the pattern stops, some of them even reacting the player's initial position. These bullets are different based on the character.  Hit CombosAfter defeating an enemy, they will explode. These explosions can damage and destroy other enemies, and when other enemies get caught in the successive explosions of previous enemies, a combo counter will appear in the top left-hand corner of the player's field, indicating the number of enemies caught in the chain reaction.After a brief moment of inactivity, the combo counter will reset to 0. Special BonusesThere are 4 special bonus items which can be obtained whenever an enemy's boss or  Lily White is defeated.The ""EX"" item will unleash a number of EX attacks upon the opponent, and the ""G"" item will fill up the player's spell gauge. The blue item which resembles the point items from previous Touhou games adds 100,000 points to both the score counter and total points. The orange item causes a large number of bullets to appear at the top of the opponent's field.Extra ModeUnlocked once the player has viewed endings 1 - 12 in story mode, allowing the player to play through Komachi's ""story mode."" Throughout Extra Mode, there are no continues, and both the player and the opponent start with half a health dot each. The AI also has an invincibility period which is shown under the player's sprite, meaning the player must survive through this period before the match can be won.  After completing Extra Mode with Komachi, the player will then be able to play through Sikieiki's ""story mode,"" and once this has been completed, all characters can be played in Extra Mode and Komachi and Sikieiki can be played in the official story mode. CharactersPhantasmagoria of Flower View features 16 different playable characters and one un-playable character:   Reimu Hakurei - The Wonderful Shrine Maiden of Paradise Basic Performance  - Normal Speed: âââ   - Charge Speed: âââââ   - Focused Speed: â   - Scope: Large Circle   - Scope Generation Speed: âââ  - Specialty: Small Hitbox  - Charge Shot: Hakurei Amulet - EX Attack: Yin-Yang Orb  - Charge Lv2: Spirit Sign ""Ying-Yang Sign"" - Charge Lv3: Spirit Sign ""Fantasy Seal"" - Boss Attack: Spirit Sign ""Hakurei Illusion"" - Motto: ""Wafting Clouds and Stream"" Â  Serenity of mind becoming a person who is identified with the clouds in the sky and the stream below. Â  This phrase shows that Reimu isn't bound to anything and lives naturally.   Reimu is surprised by the increasingly large number of flowers, causing her to go out in search for answers as she believes that it is her duty, but also because she doesn't wish for people to think of her as negelctful.   Marisa Kirisame - The Oridinary Magician Basic Performance - Normal Speed: âââââ  - Charge Speed: âââ   - Focused Speed: âââ and a half  - Scope: Infinite forward   - Scope Generation Speed: âââ  - Specialty: Gauge fills quickly  - Charge Shot: Illusion Laser - EX Attack: Earthlight Ray - Charge Lv2: Magic Sign ""Stardust"" - Charge Lv3: Magic Sign ""Stardust Reverie"" - Boss Attack: Magic Sign ""Illusion Star"" - Motto: "" Sturm und Drang"" Â  This phrase shows Marisa's character preferring power and might.   Marisa doesn't look too deeply into the situation at hand, and she sets out to find the cause simply because she feels like it.     Sakuya Izayoi - The Perfect and Elegant Maid Basic Performance - Normal Speed: âââ  - Charge Speed: ââââ  - Focused Speed: ââââ   - Scope: Travelling direction opposite sector   - Scope Generation Speed: âââââ  - Specialty: Activated spirits do not drift upward  - Charge Shot: Jack the Ripper - EX Attack: Another Murder - Charge Lv2/3: Time Sign ""Private Vision"" - Boss Attack: Time Sign ""Mysterious Jack"" - Motto:   ""  Cut the Gordian Knot "" Â  This phrase shows Sakuya's elegance and her knife skill.   Sakuya feels that the incident isn't anything dangerous, and so she searches for answers so she can satisfy he curiosity.   Youmu Konpaku - The Half-Human Half-Ghost and Half-BakedBasic Performance  - Normal Speed: âââââ  - Charge Speed: Half a star - Focused Speed: â   - Scope: Slowly Expanding Oversized Circle   - Scope Generation Speed: â  - Specialty: Her sword can destroy bullets  - Charge Shot: Stopping/deciding wandering sword - EX Attack: Hesitant soul - Charge Lv2/3: Hesitant Sign ""Sword of Earthly Desires"" - Boss Attack: Hesitant Sign ""Disillusion of Half-ghost"" - Motto: ""Whole Body and Soul"" Â  This phrase shows that the half-human half-spirit Youmu is doing her best both in the aspects of both Body and Spirit.   Youmu begins searching for answers whilst admiring the scenery which had been created, although she has no idea as to where she should start. However, she is one of the very few who notice the ghosts which are lingering around the flowers.   Reisen Udongein Inaba - The Moon Rabbit of Insanity Basic Performance - Normal Speed: ââââ  - Charge Speed: âââ and half a star - Focused Speed: ââ and half a star  - Scope: Rotary Eye Type   - Scope Generation Speed: âââââ  - Specialty: Activated spirits move upward quickly  - Charge Shot: Mind Explosion - EX Attack: Metaphysical Mind - Charge Lv2/3: Wave Sign ""Luna Wave"" - Boss Attack: Scatter Sign ""Luna Megalopolis"" - Motto: ""Periods of Ebb and Flow"" Â  Everything flourished must ebb. Â  This phrase shows that Reisen lived at the prosperous Moon Capital and then escaped during the Lunar War so as to join her two masters later, and is now living freely after the events ofÂ Â Â Â   Imperishable Night  Reisen doesn't see any need to worry about the flowers, but she decided to check them out anyway. She also takes this as an opportunity to search for Tewi, who wandered off somewhere without saying anything.     Cirno - The Little Ice Fairy Basic Performance - Normal Speed: ââââ  - Charge Speed: ââ and a half star - Focused Speed: âââââ   - Scope: Small circle   - Scope Generation Speed: âââââ  - Specialty: Activated spirits do not self-destruct as quickly as they do for others.  - Charge Shot: Icicle Attack  - EX Attack: Icicle Fall - Charge Lv2/3: Freeze Sign ""Perfect Freeze""  - Boss Attack: Freeze Sign ""Cold Divinity""  - Motto:  "" Kill Two Birds with One Stone"" Â  This phrase shows Cirno's simpleness as it what most children say when they are told to have any proverb. Her interpretation of it is that she is great, and that her Spell Card ""Icicle Fall"" is effective both in attack and defense.   Cirno notices early on that something is strange about the flowers, and she is also the first one to realise that a similar event happened 60 years ago. Despite this, she isn't interested in why it is happening, as she only wishes to enjoy herself.   Lyrica Prismriver - The Poltergeist KeyboarderBasic Performance - Normal Speed: âââ  - Charge Speed: ââ  - Focused Speed: â and a half star  - Scope: Infinite vertical   - Scope Generation Speed: ââ  - Specialty: Can fire behind self as well  - Charge Shot: Keyboard Spirit - EX Attack: Phantom Noise - Charge Lv2/3: Noise Sign ""Soul Noise Flow"" - Boss Attack: Noise Sign ""Lyrica Solo Live"" - Motto: ""Brilliance and Shining of Light"" Â  This phrase shows that Lyrica is one of the Prismriver Sisters.   Lyrica takes no interest in the incident at hand. All she wants is to collect new sounds and find a good place for a solo performance but, unfortunately, she continues to bump into other characters as she steadily loses her way.  Merlin Prismriver - The Poltergeist TrumpeterBasic Performance - Normal Speed: ââ and a half star  - Charge Speed: â  - Scope: Horizontal infinite  - Focused Speed: â  - Scope Generation Speed: ââ   - Specialty: Can fire slanted shots  - Charge Shot: Riverside Song - EX Attack: Trumpet Soul - Charge Lv2/3: Noise Sign ""Soul Go Happy"" - Boss Attack:Noise Sign ""Merlin Happy Live"" - Motto: ""Alpine Stream"" Â  Being superior to music as streaming water on high mountain. Â  Merlin's phrase is somehow different from the other sisters', despite it being Lyrica who is different when it comes to ability and the condition to play.   Merlin has no interest whatsoever in the incident at hand.   Lunasa Prismriver - The Poltergeist Violinist Basic Performance - Normal Speed: ââââ  - Charge Speed: âââ  - Focused Speed: ââ and half a star  - Scope: Horizontal & vertical infinite   - Scope Generation Speed: âââ  - Specialty: Can fire three-way shots  - Charge Shot: Tuning - EX Attack: Slow Sound - Charge Lv2/3: Noise Sign ""Noise Melancholy"" - Boss Attack: Noise Sign ""Lunasa Solo Live"" - Motto: ""Brilliant and Shining"" Â  This phrase shows that Lunasa is one of the Prismriver Sisters.      Mystia Lorelei - The Mysterious Night Sparrow Basic Performance - Normal Speed: âââââ  - Charge Speed: ââ and a half star - Focused Speed: âââââ   - Scope: Small Forward Circle   - Scope Generation Speed: âââ  - Specialty: Spirits often come flying right at her  - Charge Shot: Little Battalion - EX Attack: Bird Watching - Charge Lv2: Bird Sign ""Human Cage"" - Charge Lv3: Bird Sign ""Human Cage Double"" - Boss Attack: Bird Sign ""Mysterious Song"" - Motto: ""Careless Song and Loud Poem"" Â  This phrase shows Mystia's freewheelingness.   All Mystia wants to do throughout the entire incident is create music, causing her to sing her way into most encounters.   Tewi Inaba - The White Rabbit of Good FortuneBasic Performance - Normal Speed: ââââ  - Charge Speed: âââââ  - Focused Speed: Half a star  - Scope: Eye Shape   - Scope Generation Speed: âââ  - Specialty: Autobomb (when life gauge reaches 0.5)  - Charge Shot: Two Rabbit Chase - EX Attack: Rabbit Ball - Charge Lv2/3: Rabbit Sign ""Great Fortune Crest"" - Boss Attack: Rabbit Sign ""White Rabbit of Inaba"" - Motto: ""A Wise Rabbit Has Three Lairs"" Â  Being cautious enough to get out of lots of trouble.   Tewi got so excited by the sudden appearance of the flowers that she forgot to tell Reisen where she was going.   Aya Shameimaru - The Traditional Genso ReporterBasic Performance  - Normal Speed: ââââââ  - Charge Speed: âââââ  - Focused Speed: âââââ and a half star  - Scope: Forward Fan shape   - Scope Generation Speed: âââ  - Specialty: Bullets in her field are a little slower  - Charge Shot: Auxiliary Fan - EX Attack: Tengu Gale Bullet - Charge Lv2/3: Wind Sign ""Wind God's Fan"" - Boss Attack: Whirlwind ""Wind God Girl"" - Motto: ""Talking-lips are Chilled by Autumn Wind"" Â   Bashou Matsuo's Haiku which says that redundancy brings us to quarrel. It is interesting that Aya uses a phrase such as this due to her affilation with the media.  Aya takes the incident as a chance to find something newsworthy to write about the flowers, which causes her to notice the large number of ghosts lingering around them.     Medicine Melancholy - The Little Sweet Poison Basic Performance - Normal Speed: âââââ  - Charge Speed: ââ  - Scope: Star shape  - Focused Speed: ââ  - Scope Generation Speed: âââââ  - Specialty: Doesn't get hurt when colliding with a spirit.  - Charge Shot: Poison Bee - EX Attack: Sweet Poison - Charge Lv2/3: Poison Sign ""Nerve Poison"" - Boss Attack: Poison Sign ""Melancholy Poison"" - Motto: ""Poison Changes into Medicine"" Â  This may be a parody of the phrase ""turn disguise into opportunity"".   Medicine has no interest in the incident whatsoever, using it as an excuse to defeat anyone she comes across with her poison.   Yuka Kazami - The Flower Master of the Four SeasonsBasic Performance - Normal Speed: Half a star  - Charge Speed: âââââ  - Focused Speed: Half a star  - Scope: Flower shape   - Scope Generation Speed: âââââ  - Specialty: Can fire three-way shots  - Charge Shot: Flower Shooting - EX Attack: Phantastic Spring Flowers - Charge Lv2/3: Flower Sign ""Reflowering of the Gensokyo"" - Boss Attack: Phantasm ""Appreciation of the Beauty of Nature"" - Motto: ""Clouds over Moon, Wind on Flowers"" Â  Happy events tend to be accompanied by problems  Considering that she is the ""Flower Master"" and that has been around for a long time, Yuka knows exactly what is happening. Unfortunately, this secures her a spot at the top of everyone's suspect list, and the fact that she is caught enjoying the flowers doesn't help much.     Komachi Onozuka - The Ferryman of the River Sanzu Basic Performance - Normal Speed: âââ  - Charge Speed: âââ  - Focused Speed: â and half a star  - Scope: Initially covers screen but starts shrinking instantly   - Scope Generation Speed: âââââââ  - Specialty: Can instantly activate all spirits on screen  - Charge Shot: Tip of Death - EX Attack: Ties with the Deceased - Charge Lv2/3: Throw Away ""Money from the Yesterday"" - Boss Attack: Death ""Higan Retour"" - Motto: ""Dying is Loss in Death, Living is Profit in Life"" Â  It is said that as long as you are alive, you will eventually come across fortune. However, if this results in you wishing for death, from then on you will bear the misfortune of death. It means that if humans don't live on, nothing can be done. Â  This phrase shows an aspect of a shinigami's role to stop would-be suiciders from dying and persuade them to live.   The primary cause for everything that happened due to her habit of neglecting her duty to ferry souls across to Higan.   Sikieiki Yamaxanadu - The Highest Judge of the Court of ParadiseBasic Performance - Normal Speed: ââââ  - Charge Speed: âââ   - Focused Speed: ââ   - Scope: Instant Large Circle   - Scope Generation Speed: ââââââ  - Specialty: Spirits only emit one red bullet  - Charge Shot: Charge of Virtue - EX Attack: Danmaku Judgement - Charge Lv2/3: Guilt Sign ""Wandering Sin"" - Boss Attack: Judgement ""Last Judgement"" - Motto: ""Heaven Knows, Earth Knows, I Know, You Know"" Â  A saying which comes from the  Later Han Dynasty of China. When a man tried to bribe Yang Zhen (æ¥é), a high official, saying that nobody will know, Yang Zhen responded with: ""Heaven knows, Earth knows, you know, I know. Why do you say nobody knows?"" and rejected the bribe, causing the line to become a motto to justify moral behavior. Â  This phrase shows Eiki's role of judge and her character of virtue.  Lily White - The Constant AnnoyanceLily has a tendency to appear whenever matches drag on for too long, unleashing a barrage of bullets in order to defeat either the player or the opponent. Scoring There are 2 ways to increase your score in Phantasmagoria of Flower View, not including stage bonuses.  Enemies Any fairy, spirit or Boss defeated will increase the player's score slightly. Fairies award 10 x [number of fairies destroyed this match]   100 to the score counter, whilst spirits add 1,200. Once the score counter reaches 999,990, it stops increasing and instead, each fairy destroyed shows a ""BONUS!"" marker, which adds a substantial number to your total points. Spell PointsWhenever you begin a hit combo and the combo counter appears, spell points will also be accumulated, and will be shown under the combo counter. However, after a brief period of inactivity, the spell point count resets to 0, and any accumulated spell points will be added to your score.Clear Bonus  At the end of each stage, you will be provided with  bonus points based on how well you performed. The bonus is calculated like  this:Every half of a health dot remaining x 100,000  Longest combo x 100,000    Number of Fairy/Witch spells cast x 150,000Number of Dragon spells cast by Spell Points x 300,000Number of times the opponent's Dragon spell was reversed (by another Boss Attack) x 300,000Additionally, if it is the final round during Story Mode, another bonus is granted:Lives remaning x 10,000,000  The total value is then added to the player's total points. Music      In Phantasmagoria of Flower View, every character has their own theme which plays when you encounter them. The translated name of each theme is provided below the original version:  - Title Screen theme Â Â Â  è±æ å¡ ï½ Higan Retour  Â Â Â  Kaeidzuka ~ Higan Retour   ZUN note: Â Â Â  It's the same old tune, yep. Â Â Â  This is probably one of the silliest parts of the game itself, but it's remained constant over time. Â Â Â  Maybe it's not silly enough. But this is Gensokyo.  - Reimu Hakurei's Theme Â Â Â  æ¥è²å°å¾ãï½ Colorful Path  Â Â Â  Spring Lane ~ Colorful Path   ZUN note: Â Â Â  I tried to write this one so you would feel spring itself through the piece. Not purely Japanese, but more like Touhou style.  Â Â Â  I thought it'd be good to not have it wear down on people during long battles, so I controlled its intensity, but compared to other, more intense pieces, it seems pretty sedate. Like Reimu?   - Marisa Kirisame's Theme Â Â Â  ãªãªã¨ã³ã¿ã«ãã¼ã¯ãã©ã¤ã  Â Â Â  Oriental Dark Flight   ZUN note: Â Â Â  The way I first composed this one made Marisa sound like a bad guy, so I added on a bit of playful antiquity to it.  Â Â Â  In doing so, that antiquity gave it a hint of Middle Eastern flair, which could be a problem. However, given the nature of this game, I'd like to believe this properly reflects the endless stream of action and suspense that happens.   - Sakuya Izayoi's Theme Â Â Â  ãã©ã¯ãªã³ã°ãã¤ã  Â Â Â  Flowering Night   ZUN note: Â Â Â  Since all of Sakuya's pieces from Embodiment of Scarlet Devil were all very hard and driving, I tried to make this one more human, or more fitting for a first stage. Â Â Â  I can't explain why I don't think this melody fits, but how about you? What's weird to me is that if you think it's going to be an Asian piece, it sounds like it, but treat it as Western and it sounds like that too. If you think it's childlike, it's childlike, and if you think it's more mature, it sounds that way. Am I the only one who thinks so?  - Youmu Konpaku's Theme Â Â Â  æ±æ¹å¦ãå¤¢ãï½ Ancient Temple  Â Â Â  Mystic Oriental Dream ~ Ancient Temple   ZUN note: Â Â Â  It's not the Perfect Cherry Blossom version, but the arranged version recorded in Ghostly Field Club. It draws out the coldness of the land of the dead. Â Â Â  I used the boss themes for other characters, but here, I thought this one fit Youmu well, so I used it. Rather, I liked this one.   - Reisen Udongein Inaba's Theme Â Â Â  çæ°ã®ç³ãï½ Invisible Full Moon  Â Â Â  Lunatic Eyes ~ Invisible Full Moon   ZUN note: Â Â Â  I made a few tweaks to the original to make it a little more nostalgic. I had my reasons for the original, but for this game, it may have been a little too much. Almost like ""why's it so serious?"" Â Â Â  Well, Imperishable Night's pieces were all just a little too much. Because it was about night and time... well, maybe that doesn't make any sense. Could you say this one's about flowers and idiots... (oops)   - Cirno's Theme Â Â Â  ãã¦ãã°æå¨ã®åéº  Â Â Â  Adventure of the Lovestruck Tomboy   ZUN note: Â Â Â  The old stupid cute song has become cool. It's weird how that worked, and it makes you wonder. Â Â Â  Still, the melody itself seems pretty dumb. I wrote this in an Asian style, light and intense, not worrying about whether it fits the image of a little girl. Instead of Asian, it feels more Touhou, and I seem to have developed a specialty pattern without realizing it.  - Prismriver Sisters' (Lyrica, Merlin, and Lunasa) Theme Â Â Â  å¹½éæ¥½å£ãï½ Phantom Ensemble  Â Â Â  Ghostly Band ~ Phantom Ensemble   ZUN note: Â Â Â  I rearranged this piece to exude a lighter atmosphere than the original. Some time later, I want to make a piece that showcases the sisters performing solo. Â Â Â  Lunasa on violin, Merlin on trumpet, piano and accordion for Lyrica makes sense in this piece, but if you think about it, who's playing the drums and keeping beat?   - Mystia Lorelei's Theme Â Â Â  ããæ­ããèãããªããï½ Flower Mix  Â Â Â  Deaf to all but the Song ~ Flower Mix   ZUN note: Â Â Â  It's now three times more strong. Â Â Â  It sounds up-tempo enough to drive someone insane, but that's its purpose. Mystia is enjoying the flowers herself. Â Â Â  Mystia's song is said to bewilder people, but if you listen to this, it sounds like a pretty harsh song. Of course it'll drive people nuts. A punk youkai.  - Tewi Inaba's Theme Â Â Â  ãå®ä½ãã¾ã®ç´ ãå¹¡  Â Â Â  White Flag of Usa Shrine   ZUN note: Â Â Â  I designed this to be a little playful, sentimental, and Japanese. Â Â Â  How is it? It came out fairly easygoing and cute, and I think it fits this kaeidzuka to a T. Â Â Â  Actually, the notes and scales used aren't Japanese. If you were to ask me ""where's the Japan in it?,"" I really couldn't tell you. But doesn't it seem Japanese?   - Aya Shameimaru's Theme Â Â Â  é¢¨ç¥å°å¥³ã(Short Version)  Â Â Â  Wind God Girl   ZUN note: Â Â Â  This is the short version of the theme to Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red. The original piece was a long six minutes, but such long battles in this game cannot happen, so I took the mainÂ Â Â  section and looped it. Â Â Â  I imagined a wind god girl looking good playing the trumpet when I made this. Â Â Â  A world where feelings fly on the winds. This is the image I had in mind for Phantasmagoria of Flower View.  - Medicine Melancholy's Theme Â Â Â  ãã¤ãºã³ããã£ãï½ Forsaken Doll  Â Â Â  Poison Body ~ Forsaken Doll   ZUN note: Â Â Â  Phantasmagoria of Flower View's most unique composition. I wrote it to be a little Western and fairly dark in image. Â Â Â  This boss-like and strangely uplifting piece hints at older arcade games. Â Â Â  The sound of bells at the beginning of the song is a strangely unsettling sound. This is poison.   - Yuka Kazami's Theme Â Â Â  ä»æå¹»æ³é·ãï½ Flower Land  Â Â Â  Gensokyo, Past and Present ~ Flower Land   ZUN note: Â Â Â  I thought to create a piece bright and fluid, with the elegance of a flower. It didn't come out that way. Â Â Â  The main melody here is done on piano, and particularly as I was writing it, it brought back fond memories. Â Â Â  I thought it'd be better to make the piano part longer, but piano doesn't seem to fit the game all that well, so it's shorter.   - Komachi Onozuka's Theme Â Â Â  å½¼å²¸å¸°èªãï½ Riverside View  Â Â Â  Higan Retour ~ Riverside View   ZUN note: Â Â Â  To sweep away everything, and see what remains is the destiny of the mid-boss. This one reflects that fate, as well as the feeling of sweeping away. Â Â Â  Touhou has done this sweeping idea in the past, but I feel like this is the first time I've put so much exhilaration and pathos into a piece. Â Â Â  On the higan retour, that there would be no regrets as this piece...   - Sikieiki Yamaxanadu's Theme Â Â Â  å­åå¹´ç®ã®æ±æ¹è£å¤ãï½ Fate of Sixty Years  Â Â Â  Touhou Judgement in the Sixtieth Year ~ Fate of Sixty Years   ZUN note: Â Â Â  Obviously, a theme for a last boss. A melodious last boss theme is a Touhou trademark. This time, Japan   rebirth   sakura country are the images I mixed together. Â Â Â  This song full of strength and ephemerality is a song for the as-yet unseen most beautiful land of sakura. Â Â Â  As silly as the whole game may be, this piece alone evokes strong feelings.   - Pre-Battle Conversation Theme Â Â Â  è±ã®æ ãå¡  Â Â Â  The Mound where the Flowers Reflect   ZUN note: Â Â Â  Though it's an edit of the title theme, it adds a little to the nervousness before a match. Maybe it makes it all that much more illusionary. Â Â Â  If there was a problem, it's that there is no nervousness to speak of before a match. Something just seems wrong, from the beginning.   - Pre-Boss Conversation Theme Â Â Â  æ­¤å²¸ã®å¡  Â Â Â  Mound of Life   ZUN note: Â Â Â  As it's the end of the game, I prepared an element of impatience. Â Â Â  Exceptionally short, it's not much to speak of. Well, at least it's a Touhou-sounding piece.   - Ending Theme Â Â Â  è±ã¯å¹»æ³ã®ã¾ã¾ã«  Â Â Â  The Flower Like the Fantasy   ZUN note: Â Â Â  I don't know... Touhou ending themes, in their entirety, always sound like bad endings. Â Â Â  Could it be that clearing shooting games itself gives humanity a bad ending? (nah, no way)   - Staff Roll Theme Â Â Â  é­ã®è±ãï½ Another Dream...  Â Â Â  Flower of Soul ~ Another Dream...   ZUN note: Â Â Â  I thought about making a lighter staff roll than normal, but I regret making it both light and almost empty. Like I should have made one of those two stand out. Â Â Â  Well, I hope it has a sense of closure. But, it also feels like a beginning to me. It's not bad, right?

1420100,Skate Forever,399,Reforged Group,Reforged Group,0,0,0,Indie,English,,,"OverviewSkate is a skateboarding game published by EA and developed by EA Black Box for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. It was released on September 14 for the Xbox 360 and September 24, 2007 for the PS3. A sequel has been announced for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Nintendo DS, and Nintendo Wii (Though the Wii and DS sequels will feature special control schemes). Skate features professional skateboarders such as Danny Way, Rob Dyrdek, Paul Rodriguez, Chris Haslam, and more.The game takes place in the fictional city of San Vanelona, which is inspired by the real-world cities of San Francisco, Vancouver, and Barcelona. The player creates a custom character, choosing everything from hair style, decks, trucks, wheels and outfits, and hops into the world where the goal is to gain sponsors and make your way to the X-Games. This is done by performing a variety of tricks and challenges in front of cameras to gain notoriety. There are challenges such as ""own the spot"" where the player must gain a certain amount of points in a set area to make it his own, and Death Races where the player races against AI controlled skaters. Completion of these various missions unlocks new equipment and clothes. A unique aspect of Skate that sets it apart from the Tony Hawk franchise is the way it uses both of the analog sticks to control both of your skater's feet, requiring you to move them in a specific way to perform tricks. Also grinds are made by landing on the ground in a certain angle that in real life would be used as a grind. The 'Flick-It' control system that skate acquires is known for its innovation, and sometimes a bit hard to master.AmericaOnline is a feature that Skate has that the Tony Hawk series doesn't. You have various game modes to play in. You have freeskate which is basically you and a few friends skating around for fun. You can choose between either a public or a private session. You also have Jam sessions which is you skating around doing various tricks and trying to earn as many points as possible. There is also a game called S.K.A.T.E which is identical to H.O.R.S.E in basketball. The Tony Hawk series also have this, but instead of trying to earn more points, you have to copy the same trick that your opponent does. And they cannot do the same trick twice or they are forced to give up their turn.There are also races that you can do; you can do your typical Death Race which is just racing down a hill while you have to pass through various checkpoints. And you also have races which require you to do specific trick tasks before you can move on. You also have Spot Battles in which you must earn a higher amount of points than anyone else to own the spot. Several of these modes, such as S.K.A.T.E, Own the Spot, and Freeskate, can be done offline as well with up to three friends locally.CriticismWhile Skate has been received rather well, there are a number of common criticisms the game has received. One of the most common complaints is that players cannot get off of their skateboard and walk. This makes it difficult to get to certain spots, such as above stairs. Another common complaint is that the camera could be greatly improved upon. For example, the skater that the player controls doesn't become transparent as often as he should, causing the players view to be blocked. Loading times can also prove to be sporadic and annoying when using the session feature. Another criticism is that the game often requires tricks that are too specific for the controls to allow, often leading to confusion and frustration.InstallationThe optional installation on Xbox 360 requires 6.5 GB of hard drive space.SoundtrackAgent Orange - No Such ThingAirbourne - Let's RideBad Brains - I Against IBand of Horses - The FuneralBeat Beat Beat - Sinking SlowBlack Flag - Six PackBooker T & The MG's - Green OnionsChallenger - Input the OutputCheap Trick - SurrenderChildren of Bodom - Hate Crew DeathrollDavid Bowie - Queen B****Dead Prez - Hip HopDevo - Gut Feeling/Slap Your MammyEddie Rap Life - Push Your WoodEric B & Rakim - Juice (Know the Ledge)Escalera - Go It AloneFilthy Thieving Ba****** - ...Lords Of The AvenuesGang Starr - Now You're MineH.I.T - DramaMac Mall - Perfect PoisonMotorhead - We Are MotorheadNirvana - Lounge ActN.W.A - Express YourselfRenee Renee - Stand Up Talk EasyRick James - Give It To Me BabyRick Ross - Hustlin'River City - Tanlines Black KnightS.T.R.E.E.T.S - Georgia St.Sicker Than Others - Face AwaySister Nancy - Bam BamSlayer - Raining BloodThe Briefs - Poor and WeirdThe Coup - Ride the FenceThe Dwarves - MassacreThe Exploding Hearts - Your ShadowThe Falcon - BlackoutThe Mag Seven - D*** CemeteryThe Ramones Psycho - TherapyThe Returnables - Teenage ImpostersThe Sex Pistols - Pretty VacantThe Stars Misplaced - Prophets And KingsThe White Stripes - Girl, You Have No Faith In MedicineTrouble Andrew - Chase MoneyValient Thorr - Man Behind The CurtainZZ Top - Just Got PaidThere are also tracks from Tommy Guerrero, that were made just for this game.",,,,,,,,,

1420160,Paranormal Stories,399,e-FunSoft Games,HH-Games,0,0,0,"Casual, Indie",English,,,"OverviewDeveloped by GiantBomb member, Matt Cohen, Paranormal is a first person 'found-footage' style horror game in which the player controls a man holding a camera, filming the activity within his haunted house. Once the camera turns on, the hauntings intensify and the player is left to survive as long as possible as the house turns against him. Armed only with a camera and its spotlight, the player must unravel the mystery of what happened in the house's past that made it such a hotspot for paranormal activity.Paranormal is built around a unique system of randomized, action-reaction variables that ensure every experience is different. The Dynamic Haunting system allows for unique experiences every playthrough, while still maintaining a steady progression. The game contains multiple endings that depend on where you are, what you do, and what has happened in your time playing the game.Main FeaturesFree Content Updates: Paranormal will launch with one scenario. Free content updates will add new locations, scenarios, characters, stories, and gameplay mechanics. The game's content will double and eventually triple with these updates.Sleep System: Sleeping in a bed recharges a camera's batteries and also has a chance of triggering other events. During slumber, the camera will switch to one of the static security cams set up around the house, allowing the player to monitor what is or isn't happening in the house as they sleep.Flashlight (camera light): Creates a bright, short ranged light that casts dynamic shadows.Creepy Sound Design: HD sound optimized for surround sound and headphones gives the hauntings an atmospheric and frightening clarity.Controller support: The game will launch with full XBOX 360 Controller support, as well as native Mouse + Keyboard.Dynamic Haunting: The dynamic haunting system is a complex system containing multiple outcomes, dynamic triggers, countless variables, and an action-reaction system, all of which direct the game's actions. This system ensures every experience is unique, while still giving the player a consistent experience that may or may not require a spare pair of pants.First-Person Camera: Much like in the movies 'Paranormal Activity' or 'The Blair Witch Project', the viewpoint will be that of a camera being held by a person (the player). Effects like camera shake, pixelation, video distortion, audio distortion, and motion blur will all be present thanks to the camera screen-space shader I built for everything. This effect can be disabled within the game's options for those with weaker stomachs.Intricate Ghost Story: Though the game can be enjoyed without paying attention to the story, there is a deep and disturbing backstory to the hauntings. The backstory is revealed through journal entries found randomly throughout the house.Graphics: Paranormal is built using Unreal Engine, implementing many of the latest graphical advances. Push your computer (and sanity) to the limits!",,,,,,,,,

1420300,No More Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle,1999,GRASSHOPPER MANUFACTURE INC.,"XSEED Games, Marvelous USA, Inc., Marvelous",328,328,3,Action,"English, French, Italian, German, Spanish - Spain, Japanese, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese",,,"OverviewAlice Moonlight depicted in the first teaser trailer.No More Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle is the sequel to Grasshopper Manufacture's 2008 game for the Nintendo Wii. Set three years after the conclusion of the first game, Desperate Struggle heralds the return of Travis Touchdown and Sylvia Christel, although times have seemingly changed for the worse. This time around, Travis is out for revenge due to the death of Bishop Shidux, one of the supporting characters from the original game who owned the video store ""Beef Head Videos"" and was also Travis's only true friend.Once again, Travis has to take down ranked assassins in his quest for vengeance. Though Travis's quest is longer than the first, as he has to start by battling the 51st ranked assassin, Skelter Helter, instead of the 10th. The 51 rankings do not, however, manifest themselves as 51 separate boss fights; many ranked assassins are killed by other characters off-screen. Additionally, the game features Henry and Shinobu as playable characters for the first time.Travis' faithful cat Jeane also returns, although is suffering from obesity. Providing exercise for Jeane through various mini-games she can be restored to a healthy weight at which point she teaches Travis a special move.GameplayTwice the thrusting and recharging.No More Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle retains the same elements that made the first game such well crafted formula. The main objective of the game remains to earn enough cash in order to enter for the next available ranked battle. Travis can still traverse Santa Destory on his Schpeltiger among visiting several locations.One of the biggest changes seems to be for the first game's money-making side jobs, which are now overhauled with 8-bit graphics and gameplay. Travis can once again catch coconuts or try out burger-flipping. Side jobs do not unlock assassination gigs as they did in the first game; instead, there are ""revenge missions"", in which Travis hunts down Bishop's killers. Apart from treasure chests with cash in them, side jobs are the only way to make money in the second game. However, ranked matches no longer require ""entrance fees""; money can be spent on clothes from the store ""Airport 51"", new beam katanas, and training at ""Ryan's Gym"".CombatNo More Heroes 2 features the same waggle-based combat of the original game, while adding stun techniques that allow for various professional wrestling manoeuvres and powered up states for Travis to perform instant kills and projectile attacks.Also new to Desperate Struggle are more beam katana types that may be switched on the fly - including the red ""peony,"" which extends as Travis' ecstasy gauge increases but takes longer to swing, as well as the pink ""rose nasty"", which are two shorter beam katanas that can be dual-wielded by Travis. More wrestling moves are also in the game, such as the gutwrench suplex and the spinning backdrop finisher.The ability to lengthen the beam katana's combo at Thunder Ryu's gym has instead been replaced by an ""ecstasy gauge"" - the ""tiger meter"" that activates during dark side mode turns red as Travis lands more hits on enemies, and turns back to yellow as he takes damage. Once the tiger is red, Travis' combo extends. When the tiger has a white outline, the player can then activate a type of dark side mode by hitting the ""-"" button.JobsLike the original game, No More Heroes 2 features an assortment of side jobs that allow Travis to earn money to spend at Ryan's Gym for life and attack upgrades or at Leona's Lab on new beam katanas. The original game featured jobs that were made deliberately tedious and unpleasant, to simulate actually performing a menial labour job, but because of the incredibly poor reception these jobs received upon the game's release, the sequel replaces them with entertaining minigames. Most emulate 8-bit retro game design and many are direct homages to NES games.Pizza with a VengeancePizza with a Vengeance shares a similar aesthetic and the feel of Sega's Hang On. Overall, Travis is tasked with delivering pizza within a designated time frame on his Schpeltiger.Man the MeatMan the Meat plays very similar to Burger Time, where Travis is required to meet certain requirements given by customers and must cook their food to their liking. This is done by holding down the A button until specified cooked time is met.Lay the PipeA combination of Sokoban and Pipe Dreams, Lay the Pipe is a puzzle game where Travis needs to use left over parts in order to create a tunnel for the water flow to pass through. The flow of water increases the urgency of well time places and overall strategy.Bug OutBug Out is a mini game where Travis uses a high powered vacuum to clear out rooms of crawling insects that infested have a restaurant.Tile in StyleTile in Style is a similar to Tetris but only gives a specified amount of blocks, Travis than needs to fit them into the area before the time expires.Getting TrashedGetting Trashed controls very similar to Asteroids, the objective is to collect all floating pieces of garbage while dodging rock like objects. Travis is only able manoeuvre by using a rocket to propel himself in any 8 way direction and use inertia to move after.Stings So GoodStings so good is the only original job that has been carried over from the original title. It does not use 8 bit graphics; Travis is tasked with cleaning up scorpions from an open field within a time limit.Coconut GrabberCoconut Grabber is a simple game where Travis kicks trees and tries to catch the coconuts that fall out.Bizarre Jelly 5Bizarre Jelly 5 is a vertical-scrolling shooter with large-busted moe girls similar to the Parodius and Otomedius games. It is accessible in Travis' apartment and features several playable characters.CharactersTravis TouchdownTravis is the protagonist of the No More Heroes series. Travis re-enters the world of the United Assassin's Association when his best friend Bishop's head is thrown through his window at the No More Heroes Motel. Silvia Christel approaches Travis after his fight against Skelter Helter and promises Travis that he will find those responsible if he slices his way up to No. 1 assassin.Sylvia ChristelSylvia Christel is an agent of the United Assassins Association and is once again Travis' contact for the upcoming Ranked battles. After every match, Sylvia sends a clean up team to remove the remains of fallen assassins. She was once Henry's wife, but continues to seduce Travis with her assets.HenryHenry is Travis Touchdown's twin brother and is first introduced during the Rank #5 battle with Dr. Letz Shake in No More Heroes.

He than begins to regain consciousness while battling in a dangerous dream environment against Mimmy. He than defeats unnamed assassins #5 and #6 before returning to help Travis against Jasper Batt Jr.ShinobuThe former #8 ranked assassin, Shinobu is the only opponent who Travis defeated by dismembering an appendage, allowing her to flee and later offer support during the his battle with Jeane. She then traveled Asia, becoming the Number 1 assassin and returns to aid Travis during his struggle against the UAA in his mission to seek revenge for Bishop's life.Bishop ShiduxBishop runs the local video store, ""Beef Head Videos"" and is Travis' only real friend. It is revealed that the dismembered head that arrives at Travis' apartment is Bishop's which is meant to drive Travis out of hiding by the United Assassins Association.The Ranked Assassins#51 - Skelter HelterSkelter Helter is the 51st ranked assassin and the first boss in the game.

Rather, she is a character in Henry 's dream, similar to the characters in ""Bizarre Jerry 5"" and ""Pure White Giant Glastonbury"" .WeaponsBlood BerryTravis' default Beam Katana carried over from No More Heroes. It features a contracting tip that shrinks into the hilt that extends when Travis activates it.Camellia MK-IIIThe Camelia Mk-III is a modified version of Travis' final NMH beam katana, the Tsubaki MK- III, the weapon created by Travis' former mentor, Thunder Ryu.Rose NastyWhile the existence of this Beam is hinted at in NMH, it wasn't available until now. It was Bishop Shidux's last gift to his friend.PeonyThis is the final Beam Katana purchased from Leona's Lab for $300,000. It varies in power based on momentum.PAL Territory VersionSUDA51, the series' creator, announced that two versions of Desperate Struggle will be available in Europe, an ""EXTREME"" version, which will keep the game's blood intact, as well as a second ""milder"" version, which will censor the blood similar to the original game's release in PAL territories.The PAL version was released on May 28th in the UK and May 27th in Australia and New Zealand.

1419880,The Summoner,49,Old Eagle,Old Eagle,0,0,0,RPG,English,,,"Overview Â Summoner is a third-person RPG developed by Volition and published by THQ. It was a launch title for the Playstation 2, and was released on October 25th, 2000. It was also ported to PC on 19th March, 2001, and Mac OS on 12th July, 2001. It recieved decent scores from reviewers, the PS2 version scoring 74 on metacritic. The sequel, Summoner 2, was released in September 2002.Â  GameplayÂ The gameplay uses fairly standard action RPG mechanics, including a fully controllable, four person party. The player has full control over their parties levelling, able to distribute attribute and skill points where they wish. The combat is a mix of real time and turn based, with the player able to execute 'chain attacks'. These are done by pressing a direction on the d-pad with the correct timing when a character attacks an enemy. The combat system is surprisingly deep, with weapon types factoring into their effectiveness against diffrerent creatures, as well as the weapon's magical affinity being compared to the creatures strengths and weaknesses. Thanks to the joy of a third dimension, having the higher ground in a fight will count in your favour. As you progress through the game, the main character, Joseph, gains the ability to summon creatures as powerful allies in battle. Once summoned, the player can fully control the creature if they wish. There are risks involved with summoning, however. If Joseph happens to fall unconcious while a summon is out, it could turn on your remaining party members, which often results in failure, as well as broken controllers. Alongside the robust combat system, Summoner contains an awful lot of text to read. The towns were fairly large, and most of the NPC's could be spoken to, if only briefly. Main characters often have a lot to say, most of it being important plot information. This focus was a large departure from the usual console RPG's of the day. Most NPC's would also offer sidequests wich offer an abundance of information on the lore of Medeva, the kingdom the game takes place in. The character you team up with through the game also have their own sidequests and storylines.Â  Plot Â Main character Joseph was born with the mark of the summoner on his hand. As a boy, he attempted to use his power to save his village, Ciran, from attack by summoning a demon. He isn't powerful enough to control said demon, which proceeds to kill his family, friends and neighbours while destroying the entire village. Joseph flees and vows to never use his powers again. The vow is (somewhat inevitably) broken when Medeva's neighboring kingdom, Orenia, invades. Orenia's king, Murod, is attempting to find the man born with the mark of the summoner. Joseph's main goal through the game is to find six rings (ligh, dark, earth, air, fire, water) in order to summon a super powerful beastie and defeat Murod.Â Â Extras Â After completing the game and viewing the credits, a computer animated version of the Dungon and Dragons sketchÂ titled ""Summoner Geeks"" plays. It was circulated on the internet as a promotional video before the release of the game. It featured characters from both Summoner and Red Faction.Â  (check out the video here:Â      http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-5331429585309819856# ) Â Â Â System requirementsÂ Â Microsoft Windows   Intel Pentium II or AMD K6-2 CPU    64MB RAM  4x CD drive 800MB hard disk space 8MB DirectX 8.0 compatible video card  DirectX 8.0 compatible sound card     Windows 95/98/ME Mac  300Â MHz PowerPC G3  or better CPU  64MB Ram   8  xCD drive 800MB hard disk  space  Mac OS 8.6 (not  Mac OS-X-native)Â   Sequel A sequel,  Summoner 2,   was released in 2002 .",,,,,,,,,

1419050,Total War: ROME REMASTERED - Enhanced Graphics Pack,,,,0,0,0,,,,,"OverviewAfter 9 years, Total War returns to Rome.As the eighth full installment in the Total War series, Rome II is the followup to the original Rome: Total War. In the nine years since the original's release, The Creative Assembly has been honing their game development skills in this genre through other real-time strategy games in a similar vein of gameplay such as Empire: Total War and Total War: Shogun 2. Whenever a new addition of the franchise finally arrives into the hands of gamers everywhere, the question of which point in history the next game will take us almost immediately pops up. Returning to Rome has been a fan favorite choice, but the increasing focus on gunpowder units in recent installments such as Empire and the Fall of the Samurai expansion to Shogun II made fans wonder whether a World War 1 game would be the next step in that progression. To the relief of many, however, The Creative Assembly decided that the Roman time period warrants another game filled with large battles and political intrigue. The studio feels that it now has the tech, experience and the financial means necessary to do a proper sequel to Rome: Total War.The game was released worldwide on the 3rd of September, 2013.On 29th of August 2014 the Emperor Edition of Rome II was announced. The Emperor Edition will replace Rome II on steam and any copies of Rome II redeemed after Emperor Edition releases will be automatically upgraded. It features consolidation of all free DLC along with a new free campaign called Imperator Augustus, it was released on 16th of September 2014.GameplayThe core systems of Rome II â a hybrid of real-time battles and a turn-based campaign â remain true to the franchise, but The Creative Assembly has promised to shake up the formula with an improved campaign endgame, more politically interesting empire management and more realistic, engaging real-time battles.PrologueRome II will feature a prologue campaign that will introduce and teach new players to how to play the campaign and the real-time battles. In the campaign, players take the role of fictional Roman general, Silanus, who is voiced by actor Mark Strong. In the prologue campaign, Silanus is on a quest to obtain more military power as he rises from a mid-ranked officer to a pro-consul.Grand CampaignThe Grand Campaign spans 300 turns from the year 2272 BC to 28 AD, during which the player has complete control over one of the 28 major factions within the 10 cultural identities of the time period. Some special cultures like Rome have great houses competing for senatorial prestige rather than individual factions vying for military dominance over other same culture factions. The grand campaign map stretches from the tip of Scotland to modern day Iran covering large areas of western & eastern Europe, north Africa and middle east Asia.The victory conditions for the Grand Campaign are military victories, economic victories and cultural victories. Each faction has its own specific conditions for the 3 victory conditions based around historical facts or desires.Military VictoryA military victory generally requires a large amount of settlements either be controlled through direct ownership or via your client states; or alternatively have them allied to you militaristically. The player also needs to maintain a large amount of armed forces on both land and sea.Economic VictoryThe economic victory requires a medium amount of settlements from the map, with more emphasis on controlling territory with valuable resources while having ongoing trade relations with many factions. The player also has to generate a vast income of the in game currency called talents.Cultural VictoryThe cultural victory requires the least amount of settlements to win, with emphasis on building structures that provide bonus to the spread of your culture in the region. While creating the dominate culture in a medium amount of regions the player tends to also have to research many technologies and have some trade with other factions.ArmiesOne of most significant changes to the campaign is the new army system. Unlike previous games in the series, armies cannot exist without a general and there is a limit to the number of armies a faction may field at any one time. This limit is tied to the faction's ""power"", which is calculated much like ""fame"" in Shogun 2. The intention behind the army system is to make battles more decisive â by limiting the number of armies in play, losing one becomes much more significant. To offset the new army limit, armies can now enter a ""forced march"" stance which enables them move around the campaign map rapidly. While in a forced-march, an army cannot attack, and it it is attacked the army will suffer a morale penalty in battle.Armies have unique names, emblems and traditions.Armies are raised from settlements, after which a General must be appointed to lead it. Units are recruited to armies directly; while recruiting, an army will enter ""muster mode"", during which it cannot move.For the first time, armies will be customizable beyond just the unit composition. For instance, players can change an army's name and its emblem. Over time, armies will gain ""traditions"", which persist even if an army is wiped out, so long as the new army retains the name and emblem of its predecessor.Regions and SettlementsUnlike Empire, Napoleon and Shogun 2, regions will now consist solely of a settlement and the surrounding land. New to the series are provinces, a grouping of two to four regions. If a faction owns every region in a province, they can pass edicts which apply various bonuses to that province. Additionally, all constructions options for a province can be managed from a single screen, and happiness is calculated province-wide for each faction.A Pontic province composed of three settlements (capital Amaseia indicated by star).One settlement in each province is designated the province capital. Capitals have more building slots, and a city siege map when assaulted. In comparison, all other settlements are minor settlements, their core buildings reflecting their region's specialty. When a minor settlement is assaulted, a regular land battle takes with the settlement visible in the distance. Both capitals and minor settlements will have garrisons that are mustered when attacked.Since there are no longer resource slots outside of settlements, armies can now enter a ""raid"" stance. This reduces the army's upkeep and, when in enemy territory, produces some income. If an army enters raid stance in friendly territory is causes unhappiness in the region.DiplomacyInternal diplomacy will be given some much needed complexity, with each faction consisting of multiple dynasties, tribes or bases of power. After selecting a faction, the player must chose their dynasty and throughout the game deal with rivalries, personality clashes, and even outright betrayal within their faction. Individual generals will be more prominent and developed, and have unique traits and relationships with other units. In a major change from earlier games, armies will no longer be able to move without a general to lead them.As part of an effort to streamline the often tedious endgame, the controversial Realm Divide from Shogun II has been removed, although players will still face more and more internal opposition as they grow stronger. Relationships between factions will be more granular, as specific deeds will be remembered by other nations and accumulate both with them and their own allies to form power blocs opposed to you.BattlesOn the battlefield, there will be greater unit variety and more delineation between the different factions. This addresses a major complaint with the original game, where the Roman faction featured a vast array of unique units while other factions tended to field more generic armies. For example, while Gaul and Germania shared many units and a general aesthetic in the original Rome: Total War, Arverni (Gaul) and Suebi (Germania) in Rome II will, aside from from low-level missile units and spearmen, have unique unit rosters and distinct visual styles. Between land units, mercenaries, auxiliaries, artillery and ships there will be around 700 unique units in the game.Units are more visually and behaviourally distinctive.In addition to more unique unit types, soldiers within those units will be more varied. Cosmetically, this means a greater variety of faces and clothing, and, for the first time, height differences between men. Unit-level behaviour is will also be improved with superior animation â where individual units will automatically look towards nearby enemies or raise their shields above their heads under projectile fire â and audio design, where units will let out situational 'barks' as they react to to their surroundings, such as a captain rallying his men.Rome II will feature dynamic line-of-sight which limits the player's view of the map to that of their units. Units will have varying levels of sight; for example, heavily armored cavalry units will have poor visibility due to their cumbersome helmets, or enemy units could hide behind the crest of a hill. According to The Creative Assembly, this can have a profound impact on gameplay, increasing the need for scouts and encouraging better awareness of one's flanks. Further increasing the importance of terrain, the geography of a battle map is persistent throughout the campaign, so a player that is familiar with a certain mountain pass, for example, can use that knowledge to their advantage for setting ambushes or hiding units.In a series first, naval and land battles can occur continuously on the same battle map.Rome II also introduces a new battlefield view to the series, the Tactical View. Tactical View is a high-level overview of the battlefield where groups of units are represented by colored markers, not unlike the highest zoom level in games like Supreme Commander and Sins of a Solar Empire. This view will be necessary to manage the more large-scale battles, as for the first time in the franchise, naval and land battles can take place on the same unified battle map â an attacking player may begin by breaking a naval blockade, then disembarking troops to storm a city.Historical BattlesHistorical Battles have made a return from previous installments of the Total War series. The 8 included in the game with some from DLC take place in key moments of classical antiquity in Europe and the Mediterranean. From the utter annihilation of Roman forces in the battle of Teutoburg forest to Alexander the Greats fractured empire battling each other after his death for control of territory at Raphia. The player has a chance to recreate history or alter its outcome.FactionsRome II's factions represent the major powers that were around during the centuries of Roman dominance, from Germanic and Iranian barbarians to the economic powerhouses of Carthage and Parthia. The Creative Assembly has stressed that each faction will bring their own unique gameplay experience both in the campaign and on the battlefield, as some may be better as commercial powers while others tend to have more balanced armies. There will be three common tech trees that represent civic, military and engineering advancement. Each faction also has its own political system that will force players to make specific decisions that reflect the style of that faction's government. For instance, a Roman player has to ability to choose which patrician family their leader will be a member of, which will provide them with unique traits and opportunities, while dealing with the whims of the Senate whose goals may not always align with the player's.Rome&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;img src=""http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/13/136036/2440827-rome_faction.png""&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;Like the original Rome: Total War, the player chooses from one of three great Roman houses. In Total War: Rome II, these factions are the Julia, the Cornelia, and the Junia. Each faction will have unique cultural, economic and martial benefits along with enjoying Rome's excellence in metalwork and a superior military. The Roman military is disciplined, well-equipped and well-rounded with an equal emphasis on regular infantry and cavalry.Carthage&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;img src=""http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/13/136036/2440828-carthage_faction.png""&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;As an economic power with a small population, Carthage, founded by Near-Eastern Phoenician settlers in North Africa, relies primarily on mercenaries units for its military might although it may also deploy elite indigenous units like the Sacred Band and mighty War Elephants. Like the Roman faction, players may choose between one of three major Carthaginian political powers, each of which confers unique benefits. Carthage's army is mainly led by Hannibal Barca, considered one of the greatest military commanders in history.Iceni (Britannic Tribes)&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;img src=""http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/13/136036/2440842-iceni_mon_256.png""&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;The Iceni are an Iron-Age tribe from southern Britain who, unique among Celtic tribes, go to battle wearing characteristic blue warpaint. They rely primarily on infantry, who usually wield sword and spear coupled with large rectangular shields. A warlike culture means the Iceni population's happiness will increase as the tribe declares war.Arverni (Gallic Tribes)&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;img src=""http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/13/136036/2440845-averni_ico.png""&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;The Arverni are a warlike tribe from central Gaul. Like the Iceni, the Arverni are dependent on their infantry, wielding elite units like the Oathsworn and Spear Nobles. The Arverni are deeply spiritual, and as such often defer to their Druids in matters of war and peace.Nervii (Gallic Tribes)The most fierce and powerful of the Belgic tribes, the Nervii are a melting pot of Celtic and Germanic heritage. Their unit roster reflects this mix of cultures, opening up the possibility of creating new, unique army compositions.Galatia (Gallic Tribes)The Gauls of the East, the Galatians migrated to Asia Minor following the Celtic invasion of the Balkans. They arrived through Thracia at around 270 BC, led by generals Lotarios & Leonnorios. They start deep within Hellenic territory and have numerous hostile factions by them right from the start.Boii (Gallic Tribes)One of the largest of the Gallic tribes, the Boii occupied Cisalpine-Gaul, Pannonia, Bohemia and Transalpine Gaul. Their numbers make them a force to be reckoned with but they are somewhat disconnected from other the Gallic tribes geographically and are directly exposed to the ferocious Germanic clans and the Dacians.Suebi (Germanic Tribes)&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;img src=""http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/13/136036/2440850-mon_256icon.png""&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;A coalition of Germanic tribes, the Suebi habit the lands northeast of Gaul. They are not a unified nation, rather this faction is made up of tribes that share a common language and religious beliefs. Suebian warriors are usually lightly equipped, and rarely use swords. Instead, they make use of a javelin-like spear known as the framea.Parthia (Eastern Empires)&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;img src=""http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/13/136036/2452429-r2_logomon_256.png""&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;The successor to the ancient Persian Empire, the Parthian Empire is a multicultural confederation, consisting of an Iranian ruling elite, the Parthians and Persians, along with the Babylonians, Hellenistic Greeks, and other local tribes within the Middle East and Central Asia. Parthia relies on its strong cavalry to win its battles, as they wield nomadic horse-archers as well as heavy cavalry that's equipped with scaled bronze and iron armor (i.e. cataphracts, or knights). Parthia is considerably weaker on the infantry side, as it relies on Persian hillmen, skirmisher units, and sometimes Seleucid mercenaries, to fight on foot.Pontus (Eastern Empires)Pontus is a collection of Greek colonies ruled by a re-emergent Persian dynasty. Fueled by valuable commodities and keen leadership, Pontus ranks among the most powerful Hellenistic states. Seen as progressive, Pontus maintains close ties to Greek states and successor kingdoms. Bronze-shield pikemen make up the backbone of the Pontus military, with their deadly scythed chariots striking fear into the enemy.Athens (Greek States)&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;img src=""http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/13/136036/2480885-athensicon.png""&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;Athens is renowned for its cultural achievements in architecture, art, writing, and government, and is at the vanguard of Greek culture.

On land, Athens fields a formidable combination of spear-wielding Hoplites supported by archers.Epirus (Greek States)&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;img src=""http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/13/136036/2480887-epirusicon.png""&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;Epirus is a Greek kingdom consisting of numerous small towns and villages.

Eripus maintains a balanced army of cavalry, archers, pikemen, peltasts and war elephants.Sparta (Greek States)&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;img src=""http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/13/136036/2480888-spartaicon.png""&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;Sparta is a militaristic Hellenic society composed of The Spartiates (citizens), The Periokoi (non-citizen merchants and traders) and The Helots (slave labours). With The Periokoi and The Helots fueling Spartan society, citizens are free to pursue martial perfection. Renowned for their discipline and virtue, Sparta continues to produce arguably the finest soldiers in the Hellenic world.Egypt (Successor Kingdoms)The Ptolemaic dynasty of Egypt was founded by the Macedonian general Ptolemy after the death of Alexander, and as such has close ties to the Hellenistic world. Since conquering Egypt, the Ptolemies have embraced Egyptian customs, ruling as Pharaohs and worshipping Egyptian gods. This shared culture has bled over to the military, resulting in a balanced fighting force that makes use of spear and pike, skilled swordsmen, scythed chariots and exotic war elephants. Egypt's final Pharaoh was Queen Cleopatra.Seleucid (Successor Kingdoms)&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;img src=""http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/13/136036/2533972-seleucid_icon.png""&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;Based in Syria, founded by Alexander's general Seleucus Nicator, it is essentially a Hellenistic state that has assimilated much Near-Eastern culture. They are renowned for their cities and civil engineering, and in the process, developed an abhorrence for the concept and practice of slavery. Their multiculturalism means they suffer less from public order issues arising from foreign cultures entering their territories.On the battlefield, the Seleucids have access to a diverse roster of units such as the elite cataphracts, horse skirmishers, war elephants and a core of excellent spear and pike infantry.Macedon (Successor Kingdoms)The Macedonian military draws heavily from the traditions of Alexander, relying primarily on infantry and cavalry. Historically not a naval power, Macedon will have to rely on other sea-faring Hellenic states for it's naval ability. Macedon will gain an advantage when fighting other Hellenic factions and each client state controlled will result in improved economic and provincial growth.Baktria (Successor Kingdoms)A successor state from the far Middle East Baktria started life as one of the farthest east of all of the Greek colonies that once comprised Alexander's eastern empire. The City State of Baktria had one of the densest populations of Geek colonists in Alexander's empire. This has led to Baktria fielding armies of heavily armed and armored Hellenistic style troops. Though due to its location and influence from some of its more eastern neighbors the Bactrians also have access to heavily armored cataphracts as well as swift horse archers. The Bactrians are savy traders and have strong a strong industrial infrastructure. Their Hellenistic culture is also alluring to other civilizations.Royal Scythians (Nomadic Tribes)&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;img src=""http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/13/136036/2562502-scythia_256.png""&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;A nomadic Iranian tribe inhabiting the steppes of Central Asia and Eastern Europe, widely regarded as dangerous barbarians by the civilized cultures of the time, the Scythians were fierce and uncompromising in their approach to war and violence.

Like the other nomadic factions, they are adept raiders and can recruit troops rapidly from their home province. The Roxolani are keen to expand, and fight zealously in foreign lands. Despite their aggression, they also make for keen traders.Massagetae (Nomadic Tribes)&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;img src=""http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/13/136036/2562489-massagetae_256.png""&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;The Massagetae are a nomadic Iranian tribe from Central Asia, capable of raising armies at a rapid rate and striking their enemies quickly. They maintain an abundance of livestock, a result of their pastoral lifestyle, which forms the backbone of their economy. Despite being nomads, they have a history of crushing large civilized armies like the Persians with their fierce horsemen.Getae (Balkan Tribes)The Getae are a group of tribes settled around the Lower Danube. They are famous for their impressive shock cavalry, whose reputation was forged during time under the control of their neighbours, the now-weakened Odrysian Kingdom. Now, taking advantage of instability in the Hellenistic world following the death of Alexander the Great, the Getae have re-established an independent culture of their own. Ready to strike against former rulers and weaker neighbours alike, resistance will be crushed and aggression returned one hundred-fold.Downloadable ContentDownloadable content available for Rome II: Total War expands over previous total war games by offering a wider range of content for the player to purchase.Downloadable CampaignsFollowing on from Shogun II:Total War's DLC campaigns Rise & Fall of the Shogun, similar campaign packs have been released for Rome II.

1419320,System Control,0,Fatfrogg,Fatfrogg,0,0,0,Strategy,English,,,"OverviewControl is third-person action game developed by Remedy Entertainment, known for such titles as Max Payne and Alan Wake, and published by 505 Games for PC, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4.The story centers around protagonist Jesse Faden who in the process of searching for her lost brother is drawn to the titular Federal Bureau of Control, a government agency residing in a supernatural structure called The Oldest House in the middle of New York. Moments after entering the building Jesse becomes entwined in an hostile takeover raging inside the agency between the agents and the mysterious Hiss. Through the ensuing conflict and pursuit of her sibling she uncovers both secrets about the bureau as well as her own past.GameplayControl continues Remedy's tradition of fast paced action shooters that heavily favor movement as the game does not include any sort of cover system. With a non-regenerating health bar that can only be topped off by collecting blue bits from shot enemies, the player is actively encouraged to stay in the thick of combat with a risk reward system of healing through dealing damage. The inclusion of supernatural abilities helps add another dimension to the classic gunplay. Jesse initially starts out with just the Service Weapon, a supernatural firearm that can shift into different forms taking on archetypal properties of a pistol, shotgun or machine gun among others. Interestingly Remedy decided on foregoing traditional ammo pickups in service of regenerating ammo. As Jesse progresses through the game she is able to obtain various supernatural abilities which similarly work on a regenerating system. Having both weapons effectively on varying cooldowns creates a natural rhythm of switching off between abilities and firearm. Both weapon and abilities can be upgraded throughout the game as well as augmented with Mods via random enemy drops or a simple crafting system.Another new development for Remedy is a non-linear approach to level design. Past games like Max Payne or Quantum Break were linear experiences that funneled the player from encounter to encounter. Through the Oldest House, Control introduces an open-world design that allows the player to explore the bureau and take on side activities in additional to their primary objective. The level design uses keycards in increasing security levels as a way of gating access to different divisions of the bureau, as well as natural obstacles that can only be overcome through the use of specific abilities. Plenty of NPCs that Jesse meets along the way will have unique missions that feature bespoke content that can optionally be completed. In order to fuel the crafting system there are also Bureau Alerts that function like randomly generated combat encounters - the bureau is constantly under attack from the Hiss and these special targets will reward the player with Mod drops and crafting materials.

1418730,Shachibato! x Hyperdimension Neptunia Collaboration 1,199,Preapp Partners,Preapp Partners,0,0,0,"Adventure, Simulation, Strategy","English, Simplified Chinese, Japanese",,,"OverviewHyperdimension Neptunia is a PlayStation 3 game developed by Compile Heart and published in North America by NIS America. The game takes place in a bizarre universe where video game consoles and developers are personified. These personifications, often called console-tans when dealing with video game systems or gijinka in general, are represented by cute and attractive, or ""moe,"" girls. In Neptunia, these heroines battle each other in Celestia (a parallel world to the human one) in what is essentially a representation of the console wars. While in the human world, the evil goddess Arfoire has unleashed monsters upon mankind. Arfoire's name is meant to sound like R4, a type of flash card commonly used to pirate Nintendo DS games. In the Japanese version, the goddess's name is ""Majicon,"" another name used in that country for such flash cards. Neptune, the main character of the game, and the other goddesses of the major consoles must band together and use the ancient tome Histoire to battle the goddess of piracy. The story is conveyed through static images and text, similar to most visual novels.The game's main character, Neptune, is a personification of the unreleased Sega Neptune. Compile Heart secured approval from Sega to use the name Neptune, and as a result, she is the only character based on a console that is named after the console she represents. The game also contains appearances from classic Sega characters including Alex Kidd.GameplayHyperdimension Neptunia uses a turn-based battle system. During battle, each character has action points (AP) that are spent to create four-part combos from a customizable, branching menu system, including actions like attacks, defense, healing, etc. During these combos, the characters can transform into their goddess forms. Also. players can summon ""guardian angels,"" represented by classic Sega characters or photos from the PS3's album, that grant them bonuses.In regards to photos, the game features two image implementation systems, EDIT and EMBLEM.EDIT system being usedEDIT allows players to import an image from the PS3 photo album and use the image as an attack.EMBLEM would appear on her back.EMBLEM allows players to change the image on Neptune's back to an image from the PS3 photo album.WorldsThe world of Gamindustri, existing in the Celestia realm, is divided into four landmasses, each ruled over by a goddess and Basilicom, their form of government.DescriptionScreenshotPlaneptuneMain page: PlaneptunePlaneptune Is protected by the goddess (and main character) Neptune, also know as Purple Heart. It has been three years since Neptune has been seen after her battle with an overlord and is believed defeated. In her absence, rifts have formed, allowing monsters to ravage the lands unchecked.PlaneptuneLastationMain page: LastationLastation Is protected by the goddess Noire, also known as Black Heart. This land relies heavily on industrial business, which is why many factories exist here. However, the establishment of the company Avenir and its unprecedented growth over three years has sent Lastation into economic decline.LastationLoweeMain page: LoweeLowee Is protected by the goddess Blanc, also known as White Heart. Lowee is different from the other landmasses. Instead of having one overarching Basilicom, each city is governed by a local Basilicom, and all of the local Basilicoms are managed by a central Basilicom, or Entremets.LoweeLeanboxMain page: LeanboxLeanbox Is protected by the goddess Vert, also known as Green Heart. Filled with nature and peace, Leanbox is the opposite of Lastation. It is akin to the medieval era, with aristocrats and knights living here. Once suffering from endless fighting, the goddess and her Basilicom brought peace to this land, but that peace is enforced by strict rules.LeanboxCharactersPrimary CharactersEach goddess represents it's console equivalent and rules over a specific land in Gamindustri. All four goddesses have two different forms, a human form and HDD (Hard Drive Divinity) form.DescriptionHuman FormHard Drive Divinity FormNeptuneMain page: NeptuneNeptune, the goddess of Planeptune, is the main character and represents the never released Sega Neptune console system. In battle, she can transform into Purple Heart. Neptune, unlike the other goddesses, is full of energy and tends to drag her companions into sticky situations during their adventures around Gameindustri. She also tends to be a slight airhead and is easily excited by small things that lead to her getting distracted or into trouble. She has lost her memory after being cast down from Celestia and aims to save the mysterious Historie, a tome that can only contact her via mental voice messages.Purple Heart is Neptune's goddess form. In this form, she is calm , confident, and not afraid to battle others if it means getting closer to her ultimate goals.NeptunePurple HeartVertMain page: VertVert, goddess of Leanbox, is the representation of the Xbox 360 and transforms into Green Heart.Vert is quiet and quite feminine, making her popular, but she rarely appears in public. She owns all systems and her sometimes excessive gaming habits occasionally interfere with her duty as a goddess. She sees Neptune as a rival and seeks to defeat her in battle.Green Heart is Vert's goddess form. In this remarkably charming -looking form, she is calm, soft-spoken, and usually does not engage with others in violent behavior.VertGreen HeartNoireMain page: NoireNoire, goddess of Lastation, is the representation of the Sony Playstation 3 and transforms into Black Heart.Noire is the ideal goddess, hardworking and polite, but she tries too hard. She has a grudge against Neptune and seeks to defeat her at any cost to prove that she is superior. This attitude is in reference to the real-life competition between Sega and Sony, as it was Sony's PlayStation and PlayStation 2 that largely contributed to Sega's declining hardware sales and eventual exit from the console hardware market.Black Heart is Noire's goddess form. In this form, she becomes aggressive, short-tempered, and snappy with others.NoireBlack HeartBlancMain page: BlancBlanc, goddess of Lowee, is the representation of the Nintendo Wii and transforms into White Heart.Blanc is somewhat shy towards others and rarely smiles. She does not like to be bothered when doing what she wants and suffers from occasional outbursts of coarse language and throws minor temper tantrums when upset. One thing that she makes very apparent to others is her burning hatred of Neptune; Blanc believes that defeating Neptune will signal the end of the console war that has been raging for many years. This is an allusion to the early console war between Nintendo and Sega, before Sega left the console business.White Heart is Blanc's goddess form. In this form, she becomes cold and indifferent towards others.BlancWhite HeartOther CharactersSeveral real-life video game developers are represented in this world in the form of gijinka. These developers include:DescriptionAppearanceIfMain page: IFIF, representing game company Idea Factory is a member of a guild that travels around the world, and through these travels, she has gained a wide range of knowledge.

She runs into both Neptune and Compa during one of their quests and joins their party, bringing her talents as a treasure hunter to their ranks. Her weapon of choice in battle is a pair of wicked metal claws that somewhat resemble Vega's claw weapon from Street Fighter IV. They can be upgraded with newer, more powerful variations as you progress in the game.IFGustMain page: GustA traveling alchemist who is very strict on spending money. First encountered on Lowee after completing one of the first quests for the local Basilicom.

In order to get elected, BunnyLord and his campaign staff (known as the ""BunnyLord Fun Club"") arm themselves to the teeth and systematically tear down three of the most vicious crime lords in the city, believing that doing so will convince voters that voting for BunnyLord will eliminate crime.CharactersBunnyLordA large, purple, rabbit-like person who is running for mayor. Often seen drinking milkshakes at Aunt Ruby's Diner in-between jobs. Has a personal teleportation device and a BunnyVan or BunnyCopter when he needs to get in or out quickly. Unlike other characters, speaks only in an unintelligible warbling tone, though everyone in-game can understand his words perfectly.BunnyLord Fun ClubThe campaign staff for BunnyLord's mayoral campaign that happens to double as a group of heavily-armed mercenaries.Steve: Campaign Manager, head pollster, the starting character. Wields a very accurate pistol.Cletus: Country boy who talks in a heavy Glaswegian accent. Carries a shotgun that can knock doors off their hinges. Can fire before finished fully reloading.Samantha: A Welsh lady who can reload and fire her pistol while moving, though doing so will reduce accuracy a bit.Jesus (pronounced ""Hey-Zoos""): Sexy Spaniard who will dry-hump anything. Wields an SMG he can fire while sliding.Mike: Alcoholic hitman with a sawn-off shotgun that carries only two slugs. However, Mike can do silent executions that use no ammo and moves faster than other characters.Stanley: He's never voted and has no clue what the election's about, but he has lots of experience working with a paramilitary group. His rifle has the largest capacity and can fill a hallway with bullets in seconds. Slow moving and reloading.Clive: A classy British gent who acts like a John Woo film character, holding pistols akimbo and can shoot in both directions at once with his special attack. The tradeoff is that he cannot hold any explosives. Always seen smoking a cigarette.Ronald Justice: BunnyLord's campaign lacks the funds to hire a real superhero, so he found the next best thing: a crazy man in a cheap superhero costume. On top of a standard pistol, Ronald's unique special attack makes him dash forward and kill foes with his ""magic"" hammer. The hammer can be recharged by performing executions or picking up explosive crates in the level. Also, Ronald can knock doors off their hinges just by sliding through them.Kimmy: A former Master-Ronin-Ninja-Samurai-Yakuza, Kimmy carries a sword in one hand that can instantly kill almost any enemy as her special attack. Like Ronald, she can also recharge her sword by performing executions or picking up explosive crates. In her other hand, she wields a SMG that can be fired even while performing executions, though she is very inaccurate with this weapon.CriminalsBogdan Nabatov: Russian mobster who has made ""Vodkaville"" his home.Upgraydd (a.k.a. ""Darren""): Name is in reference to a minor character from the movie ""Idiocracy."" Ruthless druglord holed up in the projects of Bredrin Park where his gang grows and sells ganja. Wears an ""Everything-proof Vest"" capable of blocking literally every attack, except for BunnyLord's ""anti-Everything-proof Vest"" Gun.Akemi: Head of the ""Pan-Asian Triad Yakuza,"" bringing everyone from Hong Kong gangsters to Japanese ninja together under her control.

California Games II was released in 1990 for the Amiga, and later for several other systems, including MS-DOS, Sega Master System, SNES, and Atari ST. The goal of the game is to score as many points as possible in five different events.GameplayOne of the game's five events.Just like in California Games, there are several events that the player can play through. In California Games II, these five events are hang gliding, jet skiing, body boarding, snowboarding, and skateboarding. The player completes each of the five events sequentially, and then is awarded a point total at the end, depending on the player's performance throughout the events.EventsHang GlidingHang gliding puts the player in control of a hang glider flying over the ocean. The goal in this game is to drop water balloons in three different tubes, each of which yields points, all while avoiding prematurely falling in the water.Jet SkiingIn the jet skiing minigame, the goal is to complete a course as fast as possible. The player is giving buoy guidelines to follow, as well as time-reducing checkpoints and ramps. If the player fails to complete it in time, they are still awarded points, but less so than a fully completed course would yield.Body BoardingIn the bodysurfing event, the player is put in control of a character swimming in the ocean. The goal is to do tricks off of a large wave in order to gain points. Failure to complete tricks, or falling off of the wave results in penalization for the player.SnowboardingSnowboarding starts the player off in the middle of a slope. The goal here is to avoid obstacles for as long as possible, and to hit the ramp at the end of the cliff face. Unlike other games, the player is given several falls before the event is failed completely.SkateboardingHearkening to games such as Skate or Die, the skateboarding minigame puts the player in control of a skater on a half-pipe course, going through tunnels and doing tricks along the way.",,,,,,,,,

Occasionally, the protagonist must leave the exosuit to explore on-foot as the suit cannot fit through small gaps or across bodies of water.In the game's story, the space patrolman Gary responds to a distress call from a research station on a distant planet that was supposedly shut down. On the way, his cat Kiki jumps on the ship's console and causes it to crash land. Since Gary is injured, Kiki is volunteered to explore the facility in a series of mech suits and find the source of the distress signal, fixing various systems along the way to appease the station's AI.

1417250,Three Kingdoms 21,199,YUANWEIZHE,YUANWEIZHE,0,0,0,Casual,"English, Japanese, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese",,,"OverviewAs the name implies, Reigns: Three Kingdoms marries its swiping gameplay with the classic Chinese tales of the Three Kingdoms. As such, the game will include notable characters from that era, such as Lu Bu. Like the previous games in the series, the story is driven by a two-choice system that fluctuates four core values on the top of the screen. When presented with a choice, the card needs to be swiped either left or right, which mimicks the motion of dating apps like Tinder.Aside from the story, Reigns: Three Kingdoms also has a role-playing (RPG) system. Certain choices can lead to missions, which are present on a map of China that gets divided into several regions. Travelling to those regions will open up different paths in the story.Combat makes up a second RPG branch and uses the card system to build a deck of warriors. In a turn-based system, each card rotates to the front of the battlefield to attack. Each card has a value for attack and health. Some cards have additional effects. If a card is defeated, it will leave an open spot in the circle of cards, where the player's health points are. The first to deplete the opponent's health is the victor. Additional fighters can be recruited by meeting them in the story.As with other Reigns games, the four core values on top of the screen can lead to different outcomes by either losing all value or stacking too much into a value. Usually, mismanagement of these values will end the game. In Reigns: Three Kingdoms, these endings boot the player back to a simulation set in the future, where an avatar with a headset will usher you back into the past era, akin to the Animus concept in Assassin's Creed games.At the time of its release, Reigns: Three Kingdoms was an exclusive on mobiles, requiring a subscription to the Netflix streaming service. It is only possible to reach the games section of Netflix through its dedicated app, not the web version.",,,,,,,,,

1416700,Grimm Shuffle,99,JasonWong,Kumogami,0,0,0,"Casual, Indie, Strategy",English,,,"PlotRin Tsuchimi is your average human high school student. He lives in an alternate world where Humans, Gods and Devils coexist peacefully. He lives with his childhood friend Kaede, as his parents and Kaede's mother passed away in a car accident.Â  Kaede's father, who had been looking after both of them, went away on a long-term business trip, leaving the two alone. One day, the princesses of both the God and Demon realms, Sia and Nerine respectively, arrive in this world with their fathers who have designated him to be their husband. Who's husband, he has to choose. Unable to choose between those two and his childhood friend Kaede, the two princesses move to live nearby (nearby being next door on either side of his house) and attend the same school as him, both trying to win his heart. However, not only does he have the princesses and Kaede, but also Rin's friend Asa. Also, a mysterious demon known only as ""Primula"" appears who also seems to love Rin.  GameplayShuffle! is a standard visual-novel which means gameplay mostly consists of reading the story as told through the eyes of Tsuchimi Rin. Throughout the game, you will make decisions which affect the story and decide which heroine you (Rin) falls in love with. These heroines are Sia (god), Nerine (demon), Primula (demon), Kaede (human) and Asa (human).Â  There are 2 H scenes per heroine in Shuffle! (PC version only).Â  After clearing the game, the player may choose to watch the H scenes again, view artwork for the various characters and listen to the soundtrack of the game.Shuffle! On the StageThe PS2 port of the game, Shuffle! On the Stage was released a year later in 2005. Due to Sony's ruling against explicit adult content on its consoles, all sex scenes were removed. To compensate for this, the storylines of the 5 heroines have been extended.Â  In addition to this, two new paths are available: Kareha and Mayumi.Â  However, there are some inconsistencies with the dialogue which make reference to the sex scenes, even though they supposedly didn't happen.Â Shuffle! Essence  The PS2 port's additional story paths and higher resolution images proved popular. On May 8th 2008, Navel announced the development of Shuffle! Essence  which will be a PC port of the PS2 version. However, as with the previous PC releases, this game will bring back the adult content for the existing characters, but will also add scenes for Kareha and Mayumi (Mayumi having two sex scenes in the sequel ""Really? Really!"" and Kareha never having one before). A release data has yet to be confirmed.Â English Versions There are two current teams working on translating the PC version of the game into English. The first is a fan translation group called ""GamePatch"". This group had been working on a translation several years ago. But, after complications, the group disappeared until July 2009 when the main translator (known only as ""Heklin"") returned to re-form the group to continue work on the project. No release date has been given for their release, though their form has a debate as to whether to release a smaller, more regular patch for sections of the game, or to wait for the final full release. The patch will require a legitimate copy of the original Japanese PC game to work. Â On 4th July 2009, the visual-novel translation company MangaGamer announced that they obtained the rights to translate and release the original PC version of Shuffle! commercially. On 10th July, MangaGamer announced the release date of August 15th 2009 shortly after the announcement by heklin of GamePatch of the reformation of the group. On 31st July 2009, the price was dropped from â¬54.95 to â¬36.95. In a statement, MangaGamer said that the price drop was ""for it to be enjoyed by more customers"".

1416420,Europa Universalis IV: Leviathan,1999,Paradox Tinto,Paradox Interactive,0,0,0,"Simulation, Strategy","English, German, French, Spanish - Spain",,,"OverviewEuropa Universalis IV is the latest game in Paradox Interactive's long running Europa Universalis franchise. It was released for PC, Mac and Linux on August 13th, 2013. The game's time frame is set from 1444 to 1820. Like previous games in the series, any nation in the world active during its time frame is playable. As a sandbox game with no true goal, the player can conduct war, diplomacy, trade, and many other managerial aspects of running a country, though missions and events in the game, if accepted, push players towards strengthening their nation and expanding their rule throughout the world. Europa Universalis IV uses an improved version of Paradox's Clauswitz engine, and brings in UI improvements from Crusader Kings II.GameplayThe game is very similar to the previous Europa Universalis 3, but it takes all of the expansions from that game as a baseline for EU4. The game features the ability to play as anyone in the world, from one of the warring Daiymos of feudal Japan, to the Ottoman Turks, even to the Iroquois of North America. Some countries, however, are higher tier countries, which means that they have much more flavor, which includes decisions, events, missions and ideas than others.The game can be played in many different ways, but all of them are dependent on one thing: the new monarch points system. This system has 3 different points, separated into Administrative, Diplomacy and Military. All 3 points are used for tech upgrades and ideas, but are also used for other things; Administrative is used to core provinces (make provinces officially part of your country) and improve stability, Diplomacy is used to spread your culture to other provinces and lower war exhaustion, Military to enact war taxes, give harsh treatment on revolting groups and recruit generals and admirals.These monarch points are also tied into the Idea Groups. The Player will get their first group at admin level 5, and these groups will help them specialize their nation with bonuses. For Example, a player playing a colonization nation will probably pick the Exploration idea group, which allows them to recruit explorers to explore the oceans, and allows for colonists. A person playing in Eastern Europe, with very little colonization aspirations, might pick a military group such as Quality or Offensive. Some nations also have unique idea groups for themselves, which unlock based on how many regular ideas the player has unlocked as well as having traditions and ambitions, which are 2 ideas that a country has when starting with the ambition being unlocked when all 7 ideas in the nation's idea set have been unlocked.Trade is one way to expand an empire, and it's one of the things that has been massively changed from EU3. There are trade nodes, which are static areas where trade centers. This trade can either stay there, or be sent upward (the trade ends at 3 nodes, however, which cannot be sent upstream; Venice, Genoa and English Channel). Individual provinces produce one out of the possible 29 trade goods, the only trade good that isn't actually traded is gold, which instead goes directly into a nation's income, though it also increases a nation's inflation, which can be brought down with inflation reducing ideas or the use of diplomatic monarch points. If the player has more trade power in the Wien (Vienna) trade node, they will want to collect from there, but they might also want to send up trade from Constantinople with their other merchant. Each node has trade value, which is how much a node is valued all together, and trade power, which indicates how much money each nation is getting (this can be improved by light ships as well as building trade buildings).The colonization game is one way to expand, and it's one that hasn't changed much from EU3. Each nation has a colonial range (which is improved by Diplomacy tech), but no nation can explore Terra Incognita (land/ocean that is invisible) without explorers. Of course, the Terra Incognita goes away after it's been explored by someone in your tech group after 50 years, so a player can wait until then. You also have colonists, which you can send to a province. These provinces will continue to grow without the colonist there, so a nation can recall them and send them somewhere else, but they will do so much more slowly. Once a colony gets 1000 people, it is now considered a regular province, but instead of the nation getting tax money from them, they get tariffs, which are protected by big ships. Colonial nations with gold producing provinces will send treasure fleets back to the colonial overlord, as long as it's home trade node is downstream from the colonial nation, on a regular basis dependent on the amount of gold being produced, the more gold the more frequent and larger amounts of ducats being sent. As with trade, treasure fleets can be pirated by nations wanting to take a bit of gold from their rivals. As tariffs go up, either by the player spending administrative monarch points or events, often by the 1700's, a colonial nation with high liberty desire might declare a war of independence to govern themselves, which if they succeed will form a new nation that is based on a real nation today.Warfare also hasn't changed much, but as of 1.2 each battle is much more deadly than it's ever been before. As opposed to Crusader Kings 2, the only army the player has is a standing one. Having a casus belli isn't required, but without it a nation gets -2 stability. The new feature that was added to impede a nation's ability to blob (get bigger) is aggressive expansion, which if left unchecked will lead to a coalition forming. It's an alliance that only works against one country, and can be joined by as many countries that meet the requirements. A belligerent France might get a coalition army against all of the Holy Roman Empire, Spain, England...The UI has been much improved. It's easy to see what the player needs to do in order to succeed; the player now has a chart of missions to accomplish, which can give claims on provinces as well as other timed bonuses when all requirements are completed. If the player has rebels, they can be brought to a screen that will tell them how to deal with them and why it's happening. The economy works a monthly basis, instead of a yearly basis Ã  la EU3.Beginning with patch 1.18, Paradox began giving names to the patches. 1.18 was titled the ""Prussia"" patch. The current version, as of March 2018, of the game is 1.25, known as the England patch as it was released along with the Rule Britannia immersion pack. Expansions & DLCLike many of Paradox's grand strategy games, Europa Universalis IV has a number of DLC available for purchase, ranging from larger DLC like American Dream or Conquest of Paradise, which add significant new gameplay content, to smaller, purely cosmetic packs.The game launched with one minor expansion, Purple Phoenix. This adds events to the ailing Byzantine Empire, and allows the restoration of the Theme system as well as many other events.They also released The Star and the Crescent in the Digital Extreme Edition pack, an event pack for Muslims. This includes many things about such things as Pilgrimages, controlling the two holy cities of Mecca and Medina, and holy wars.Their next was American Dream, which adds events to the USA.Conquest of ParadiseThe first major expansion for Europa Universalis IV, Conquest of Paradise, was originally slated for December 11, 2013, but was delayed until January 14, 2014. It features new national ideas for Native American tribes, new Native American and African tribes to play as, new Native American content, greatly expanded colonial and native politics and interactions, and finally an option to play with a randomized New World, allowing for a true Age of Discovery with a new seed every game for players to explore and conquer.Wealth of NationsThe second major expansion is Wealth of Nations. The expansion focuses on trade and adds new diplomacy options and trade companies, such as the British East India Company. There is also the ability for trade wars and privateers to be dispatched to prey on trade. This DLC is released at the same time as a free content update that added the ability to create the Suez Canal, the Panama Canal and the Kiel Canal among other balance changes and selected improvements from Wealth of Nations. Also improvements to the Hindu religion have been included.Res PublicaThe Third Expansion is Res Publica. This is only a small DLC being released during the summer holidays of the developer to allow for paid content during this period. The main focus of this DLC is, like Wealth of Nations, trade and Trade Nations. The Netherlands is a major focus of this DLC adding new ideas and events to the game. Trade Nations will also gain the ability to add trade posts in other trade areas other than the home trade zone. New government types are also being added such as the Elective Monarchy and a Dictatorship. This DLC will crossover with update 1.7 and some features of this expansion will be added free to improve the vanilla experience.Art of WarThe Fourth Expansion, titled ""Art of War"", is the biggest expansion that Paradox has ever released. This expansion is being released with Patch v1.8 and contains ""FreeLC"". The update adds over 150 countries due to the overhaul that Paradox have done on the map. The map now contains more provinces in India, North, Central and South America, The Far East, The Near East and Africa. Wastelands have also been changed to help make a better experience. This increase in provinces is to reflect on a more realistic world at the time of the game.The DLC mainly focuses on the 30 Years War and introduces new mechanics in religion. Religious Leagues are now a major system and are designed to create long wars between many nations as happened historically. The DLC also reduces the micromanagement of units by allowing ships to upgrade, automatic transport and an change to the Collage of Cardinals by making them based on provinces. The DLC also adds mothballing of fleets to the game which is hoped will help players in the economy as mothballed fleets require less upkeep.A number of unit packs and a song pack were also released with this update.El DoradoThis is the fifth expansion for the game, released in conjunction with the 1.10 patch.The focus of this update is the Nation Editor, which allows the player to create custom nations. This feature is aimed at increasing the already massive re-playability of the game. It also includes new game set up derisions such as 'Random Base Province Tax' and Random Nations.The expansion focuses on Central and South America by introducing new religions and events for these countries. The expansion also changes the exploration of the Americas as Explorers can now be sent to search for great lost treasures, such as the DLC's namesake El Dorado and the other cities of Gold.Common SenseThe sixth large expansion for the game, Common Sense was released alongside patch 1.12. The expansion focuses on the new provincial development system, where the player can improve their provinces base manpower, base development, and base tax through the use of monarch points. Common Sense also adds new depth for theocracies and other government types. Religions such as Protestantism and Buddhism have also had new mechanism put in place.The patch that was launched alongside the DLC also introduces many new, free changes to the game. Both the fort/sieging systems and the building systems were completely reworked. The mission system was also changed to give more interesting rewards, such as a buff for a few years instead of just monarch points.The CossacksThe seventh expansion DLC release, The Cossacks focuses on Eastern Europe and the Hordes. The expansion provides greater depth in managing politics by adding Estates (The Church, Nobles, bourgeoisie, ect.) and changing AI interaction by deepening the users ability to control foreign relations. The DLC also adds new religion mechanics, new Horde actions and mechanics, an advanced culture change ability, Native Policies and new espionage ideas. This DLC was released at the same time as patch 1.14, one paid content pack and one paid music pack.Mare NostrumThe eight expansion DLC release, Mare Nostrum was released alongside patch 1.16 on April 5th, 2016. This expansion focuses on reworking parts of the naval game, such as allowing Barbary nations to raid European shores and adding several new naval mission types. Another major feature is the inclusion of the game timeline, which allows a player to watch the world change through their game.The free patch released alongside the DLC including a reworked espionage system and a new mechanic called ""Corruption"", which effects various facets of an empire. A content pack was also released along with Mare Nostrum.Rights of ManThe ninth expansion DLC, it was released on October 11th, 2016. Accompanying the release was patch 1.18, also known as the ""Prussia Patch"". Several major features were added in this patch, and one of the biggest was an overhaul to the technology system where countries embrace ""Institutions"" rather than simply having a flat penalty to technological advancement based on culture. Also included are ruler and military leader personality traits, ruler abdication, heir disinheritance, and Great Powers along with a few Great Power mechanics. Great Powers are the 8 strongest nations in the game. Also included are new mechanics for the Coptic religion, as well as new government types for the Ottoman and Prussian governments.Mandate of HeavenThe tenth expansion DLC focused on east Asian, and was released on April 6th, 2017. The focus on Asia included new mechanics around being the Emperor of China. A position that includes a new form of government that can pass various decrees and imperial reforms, and is strengthened by making neighboring nations into tributaries. Tributaries are a new type of vassal that are protected by the Emperor, but must pay a yearly tribute to that country.

Arkham (the fictional city that most of the game's events take place) survives this event under mysterious circumstances and is now trapped between hostile, alien dimensions. Stygian is heavily inspired by the fictional works and modern mythology of H. P. Lovecraft. Stygian adds unique elements like a Belief System, Sanity mechanics and Mental Conditions to the old-school RPG formula. The player chooses a 1920s archetype such as an Investigator, Explorer or Actor and shape his or her character by making decisions in the areas of attributes, skills, backgrounds and such. Stygian's game-play can be summarized as a mix between adventure game like exploration, rich choice based dialogue and turn based combat with an action point system.

As a free-to-play game, the game includes basic banner advertisements.The game later received a spiritual successor with Microsoft Sudoku.GameplayThe game has two play modes: the classic mode and the lightning mode.In the classic mode, you just have to solve the sudoku puzzle without any limits. This mode has 5 difficulty levels (some have recommended ranks, however you can start a new game on all of them, regardless of your rank):Training - 4x4 puzzleEasy - 9x9 puzzle, recommended rank: PlayerModerate - 9x9 puzzle, recommended rank: CasualAdvanced - 9x9 puzzle, recommended rank: AddictExpert - 9x9 puzzle, recommended rank: MasterThe concept the lighning mode is to finish the puzzle with as much points as possible. The player's starting points are decreasing continously. If the player manages to input a correct number to the puzzle then some points are added back to the score. The lighning mode has four difficulty levels:Gentle - 9x9 puzzle, recommended rank: Player, starts with 1500 pointsEasy - 9x9 puzzle, recommended rank: Casual, starts with 2500 pointsModerate - 9x9 puzzle, recommended rank: Addict, starts with 3000 pointsIntense - 9x9 puzzle, recommended rank: Master, starts with 5000 pointsFinishing a game yields experience points, even if the player gave up the puzzle. The experience points collected will increase the player rank, and make the power ups available. The game has 8 different power ups, with functions that help the player in solving the puzzle, like give the correct value for a cell or slowing the time down, boost XP, etc. The use of the power ups are limited by the token system. Tokens are generated with time (even when not playing), and each power up has it's own token cost. The maximum number of tokens can be increased with leveling up.",,,,,,,,,

Like its primary competitor WarGaming.net, War Thunder offers all three major types of warfare (aerial, naval, ground), but does this in one single game and allows to control jets, helicopters and modern tanks as well. Players controlling air and ground or air and naval forces fight on the same battlegrounds.Aerial CombatThe aerial portion of War Thunder was originally called World of Planes. The name was changed due to perceived confusion with WarGaming.net's World of Warplanes. It features period accurate planes and locations from 1939 to the late XX century. Many historical battles from the second world war and the Korean war are represented as maps.There are multiple difficulty modes depending upon how much realism you desire. Arcade mode is essentially a more simplistic multiplayer shooter while historical battles mode will require more advanced techniques like taking off and landing during battles and realistic damage modelling.There are five countries represented in War Thunder; United States, United Kingdom, Soviet Union, Japan, and Germany. There are two more planned countries which have yet to be included in the game; Australia and Italy. Each have their own unlock trees and sets of planes. As one is levelled, that progress is not transferred to the others. Within each nationality the player has a hangar holding 3-7 planes of their own with many levelling and customisation options. Researching planes and upgrading crews use a mixture of various currencies; some earned in gameplay, some purchased with money.AlphaThe War Thunder aerial alpha ran from October 2011 to March 2012.BetaCrashing without a tail in the beta.The closed beta began in March 2012 and concluded in October 2012.

The decision to focues on small water navies instead of full-blown capital ships was made because the developers found it hard to make the latter fit within the game; a realistic approach resulted in matches taking far too long, but speeding the ships up made it too arcade-y and unrealistic.Naval combat were first announced on the 12th of August 2016 along with two premium vehicle pre-order packs that included access to closed bre-beta testing. It was also announced that unlike ground forces, naval combat would launch with all five nations at the same time. The first closed pre-beta test was held on the 2nd of December 2016, with another following a few days later.Ground CombatThe first three countries that will have playable ground vehicles are United States, Germany and the Soviet Union.

1415600,Frequency: Chernobyl,0,Drunkard Raccoons,101XP,0,0,0,"Adventure, Indie","English, Russian, French, German, Simplified Chinese",,,"OverviewFrequency is a music-rhythm game developed by Harmonix and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation 2. It was released on November 20, 2001 in North America and on June 28, 2002 in Europe.It is one of the platform's first rhythm games and is also one of the first titles to support the PlayStation 2 Network Adapter. A visually-strong presentation and a strong reception from critics would lay the ground for Frequency's sequel, Amplitude. It would also mark the beginning of Harmonix's pioneer-like reputation as console-based rhythm game masters with a highly-reveered soundtrack and addictive gameplay that still has fans asking for a third entry in the franchise.Harmonix would go on to later release Rock Band: Unplugged, a PSP-entry in the Rock Band franchise. It was highly anticipated and well-received by fans as a somewhat-spiritual successor to the Frequency franchise.GameplayFrequency broke up any given song into tracks, such as drums (always the first), bass, lead synths, vocals, and so on. Each track was represented by one side of an octagonal tube that the player swept down over the course of the game. On each side of that tube were a series of notes, either left, middle or right. You tapped out these patterns with either the square, triangle, and circle buttons or L1, R1, and R2, which was a more advanced but ultimately more flexible control scheme. Upon completing two measures of music flawlessly, the track would lock on and the player could move on to the next section. Unlocking multiple tracks in succession increased a score multiplier. Every eight measures, the song would progress to the next section, and the process would repeat. When the musical segment came around again, the previously unlocked tracks would still be on, and by completing all the tracks in a section, you could unlock a bonus 'freestyle' track, which either added an arpegginator or a scratch-pad to the music.Power-UpsSeveral power-ups were available, all engaged by the X button. The Autocatcher would unlock a track, and was good both for unlocking difficult tracks and for saving your score multiplier in case you missed a note. The multiplier power-up doubled your score for a number of measures.MultiplayerFrequency also featured a multiplayer mode where the goal was to score more points than your opponent. You were aided in this quest by several other power-ups. The Freestyler allowed you to unlock the freestyle track and score some easy points, especially once all tracks had already been unlocked. The Crippler disabled your opponent, breaking their streak and failing their attempt to unlock a track. The Neutralizer restored a track to 'locked' status, allowing you to unlock it again and get more points. The Bumper kicked your opponent off a track, allowing you the chance to unlock it. Multiplayer was simple but in the right hands, a great deal of fun.It's also worth noting that Frequency was one the first games on PS2 to have online multiplayer. It was somewhat complicated to get into, however. Upon connecting the Network Adapter Sony released to allow PS2's to connect to the web, players were prompted to insert the hardware's install disc. The disc contained a few videos of various upcoming, online-enabled PS2 titles and a demo version of Frequency. This demo was the only way to access the game's online mode. It had the first four songs of the game, but also provided players with the option to swap discs from the Network Adapter install disc to the actual Frequency game disc in order to play all the songs in the game online. Online Frequency supported up to four players and allowed users to download and play songs created in Remix mode, post remixed songs, and even remix songs together.CreativityFrequency also allowed for some clever player creativity. You could create your own 'FreQ', an avatar that represented you in the game world, by building your avatar up out of basic shapes and colors. This ability was, in fact, referenced in the song 'Super-Sprode' by Freezepop on their second appearance in a Harmonix game, Amplitude. ('You made your FreQ, so Uber-shiek. This is what you are.') There was also a limited remix option, where players could use notes from individual tracks to build up their own version of a song.MusicStage 1:The Crystal Method - ""The Winner""Akrobatik - ""Exterminator""No Doubt - ""Ex-Girlfriend (Philip Steir's The Psycho Ex Remix)""Orbit - ""XLR8R""Freezepop - ""Science Genius Girl""Stage 2:Dub Pistols - ""Official Chemical""Lo-Fidelity Allstars - ""Lo-Fi's in Ibiza""Fear Factory - ""Frequency""Paul Oakenfold - ""See It""Ethan Eves - ""Selecta""Stage 3:Powerman 5000 - ""Danger is Go!""Orbital - ""Funny Break (One Is Enough) (Weekend Ravers Mix)""DJ Q-Bert - ""Cosmic Assassins""*BT - ""Smartbomb""Curve - ""Worst Mistake""Stage 4: (Only available on difficulty hard or above)Jungle Brothers - ""What's the Five-O?""Funkstar De Luxe - ""Ignition""Roni Size & Reprazent - ""Railing, Pt. 2""Meat Beat Manifesto - ""Dynamite Fresh""Juno Reactor - ""Higher Ground""Stage 5: (Only available on difficulty Expert)Toni Trippi - ""Motomatic""DJ HMX - ""Ibiza Dreamz""Symbion Project - ""Funky Dope Maneuver""Komputer Kontroller - ""Control Your Body""Symbion Project - ""FreQout""SurgeCore - ""Luge Crash"" (Secret Song)Robotkid vs. Inter:sect - ""End of Your World"" (Super Secret Song)*The in-game version of DJ Q-Bert's Cosmic Assassins differs from retail one that appears on his Wavetwisters CD/Film.",,,,,,,,,

As a free-to-play game, the game includes basic banner advertisements.The game later received a spiritual successor with Microsoft Sudoku.GameplayThe game has two play modes: the classic mode and the lightning mode.In the classic mode, you just have to solve the sudoku puzzle without any limits. This mode has 5 difficulty levels (some have recommended ranks, however you can start a new game on all of them, regardless of your rank):Training - 4x4 puzzleEasy - 9x9 puzzle, recommended rank: PlayerModerate - 9x9 puzzle, recommended rank: CasualAdvanced - 9x9 puzzle, recommended rank: AddictExpert - 9x9 puzzle, recommended rank: MasterThe concept the lighning mode is to finish the puzzle with as much points as possible. The player's starting points are decreasing continously. If the player manages to input a correct number to the puzzle then some points are added back to the score. The lighning mode has four difficulty levels:Gentle - 9x9 puzzle, recommended rank: Player, starts with 1500 pointsEasy - 9x9 puzzle, recommended rank: Casual, starts with 2500 pointsModerate - 9x9 puzzle, recommended rank: Addict, starts with 3000 pointsIntense - 9x9 puzzle, recommended rank: Master, starts with 5000 pointsFinishing a game yields experience points, even if the player gave up the puzzle. The experience points collected will increase the player rank, and make the power ups available. The game has 8 different power ups, with functions that help the player in solving the puzzle, like give the correct value for a cell or slowing the time down, boost XP, etc. The use of the power ups are limited by the token system. Tokens are generated with time (even when not playing), and each power up has it's own token cost. The maximum number of tokens can be increased with leveling up.",,,,,,,,,

It also received a retail release in Europe sometime after.A spin-off of the Euro Truck Simulator series, and the sibling to Euro Truck Simulator 2, American Truck Simulator brings the series' driving simulation and trucking company management to the United States of America (which was previously the setting to the studio's earlier 18 Wheels of Steel series). Much of the gameplay and interface remain the same, as players can customize the game's simulation aspects, purchase and customize their own trucks and trucking business, and improve their reputation to receive better-paying deliveries.The game was originally released with the West Coast state of California as the sole locale (with Nevada as free day-one DLC) and two trucks (the Kenworth T680 and the Peterbilt 579). Additional states, as well as additional cargo types and truck accessories, were periodically added as expansions and DLC for sale. Similar to Euro Truck Simulator 2, the game has received numerous post-release updates, including revamped locales, additional truck models, gameplay improvements, and updates to the user interface.TrucksFreightliner Cascadia  International LT International LoneStar  Kenworth T 680Kenworth W900  Mack Anthem   Peterbilt 389Peterbilt 579 Volvo VNL  Western Star 49X Kenworth:Kenworth T 680Kenworth W900Peterbilt:Peterbilt 579Peterbilt 389Volvo:Volvo VNLInternational:International LoneStar International LTMack:Mack AnthemWestern StarWestern Star 49XMap RescaleWhen SCS started development on American Truck simulator, there was a small team of 4 people working on it.

On June 23, 2016, SCS announced that they where working on scaling up the map from 1:35 to 1:20.

It also received a retail release in Europe sometime after.A spin-off of the Euro Truck Simulator series, and the sibling to Euro Truck Simulator 2, American Truck Simulator brings the series' driving simulation and trucking company management to the United States of America (which was previously the setting to the studio's earlier 18 Wheels of Steel series). Much of the gameplay and interface remain the same, as players can customize the game's simulation aspects, purchase and customize their own trucks and trucking business, and improve their reputation to receive better-paying deliveries.The game was originally released with the West Coast state of California as the sole locale (with Nevada as free day-one DLC) and two trucks (the Kenworth T680 and the Peterbilt 579). Additional states, as well as additional cargo types and truck accessories, were periodically added as expansions and DLC for sale. Similar to Euro Truck Simulator 2, the game has received numerous post-release updates, including revamped locales, additional truck models, gameplay improvements, and updates to the user interface.TrucksFreightliner Cascadia  International LT International LoneStar  Kenworth T 680Kenworth W900  Mack Anthem   Peterbilt 389Peterbilt 579 Volvo VNL  Western Star 49X Kenworth:Kenworth T 680Kenworth W900Peterbilt:Peterbilt 579Peterbilt 389Volvo:Volvo VNLInternational:International LoneStar International LTMack:Mack AnthemWestern StarWestern Star 49XMap RescaleWhen SCS started development on American Truck simulator, there was a small team of 4 people working on it.

It also received a retail release in Europe sometime after.A spin-off of the Euro Truck Simulator series, and the sibling to Euro Truck Simulator 2, American Truck Simulator brings the series' driving simulation and trucking company management to the United States of America (which was previously the setting to the studio's earlier 18 Wheels of Steel series). Much of the gameplay and interface remain the same, as players can customize the game's simulation aspects, purchase and customize their own trucks and trucking business, and improve their reputation to receive better-paying deliveries.The game was originally released with the West Coast state of California as the sole locale (with Nevada as free day-one DLC) and two trucks (the Kenworth T680 and the Peterbilt 579). Additional states, as well as additional cargo types and truck accessories, were periodically added as expansions and DLC for sale. Similar to Euro Truck Simulator 2, the game has received numerous post-release updates, including revamped locales, additional truck models, gameplay improvements, and updates to the user interface.TrucksFreightliner Cascadia  International LT International LoneStar  Kenworth T 680Kenworth W900  Mack Anthem   Peterbilt 389Peterbilt 579 Volvo VNL  Western Star 49X Kenworth:Kenworth T 680Kenworth W900Peterbilt:Peterbilt 579Peterbilt 389Volvo:Volvo VNLInternational:International LoneStar International LTMack:Mack AnthemWestern StarWestern Star 49XMap RescaleWhen SCS started development on American Truck simulator, there was a small team of 4 people working on it.

Now that game has successfully launched, SCS is continuing development with a larger team and listening to customer feed back. On June 23, 2016, SCS announced that they where working on scaling up the map from 1:35 to 1:20. (Same scale as Euro Truck Simulator 2) The recasle was released as part of the 1.5 game update on December 12, 2016.1:35 scale (Highlighted in yellow) compared to the new 1:20 scale. Roads highlighted in yellow show how they where extended to meet the new scale.DLCMap expansionsNevada: was released as Free day 1 DLC when the game launched.

1415700,Euro Truck Simulator 2 - Super Stripes Paint Jobs Pack,139,SCS Software,SCS Software,0,0,0,"Indie, Simulation","English, German, French, Italian, Korean, Spanish - Spain, Simplified Chinese, Russian, Japanese, Portuguese, Polish, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, Norwegian, Swedish, Hungarian, Czech, Romanian, Turkish, Portuguese - Brazil, Bulgarian, Greek, Ukrainian",,,"OverviewEuro Truck Simulator 2 is a semi-trailer truck driving simulator and logistics management game developed and published digitally by SCS Software for the PC on October 18, 2012. It was later re-released via Steam on January 16, 2013 (after a successful Steam Greenlight campaign), received post-release Mac and Linux support, and received multiple retail versions in Europe by Excalibur Publishing.The sequel to the 2008 game Euro Truck Simulator (and its spin-offs German Truck Simulator and UK Truck Simulator), Euro Truck Simulator 2 improves the previous installment's graphical prowess and vehicular physics while increasing the depth of the series's open world (adding new paths and cities while changing the overall scale) and revamping the company management, truck customization, and player progression systems of the series.Like the original, players control a customizable truck driver and the owner of their burgeoning trucking company somewhere in Europe. After completing quick delivery jobs as a hired driver (or making a bank loan), players can eventually purchase their own semi-trailer truck, improve their classifications and reputation (to receive longer and better-paying deliveries), and expand their trucking empire (by hiring NPC drivers for their fleet and buying more trucks and garages). Much of the game's driving simulation aspects are customizable, allowing players to approach the game at their own pace (whether its a more realistic setup more suitable for third-party driving controllers or a simplified casual setup).Since the game's original release, it has received numerous updates that add new features (such as additional customization options with Steam Workshop support, the option to own customizable trailers for delivering cargo, random detour encounters, and online multiplayer) while adding new semi-trailer trucks, cargo types, and AI vehicles, improving much of the game's routes and cities, and tweaking the game's UI and physics simulation. It also has numerous expansions and DLC for sale, adding numerous locales (including Eastern Europe, Scandinavia, and Iberia), expanding other locales (including France and Italy), adding new cosmetic options, and adding new cargo types (including oversize loads). Much of the game's updates were also applied to the game's 2016 spin-off, American Truck Simulator.GameplayETS2 divides the player's attention between driving trucks throughout Europe to deliver goods and managing the logistics of the player's company.Driving GameplayETS2 is a truck driving simulation at it's core. On the outset, the player is tasked with choosing a load to haul. The player then sets off with a destination and expected time of delivery. Driving fatigue, fuel, cargo damage, truck damage, truck maintenance, and the rules-of-the-road must all be considered as the player makes their way to the drop off point.The trucks are meticulously simulated. Player's may dive as deep as they want into the simulation aspect of the game. Wipers, lights, high beam lights, a clutch and H-shift, transmission ranges, engine braking, engine retardation, blinkers, and trailer attachment are some of the things the player has full control over. New players, however, have many options to simplify the driving experience.Once the player reaches their destination, they have the option to park the trailer, which may be quite difficult in some situations. With the trailer successfully delivered, the player is rewarded (minus damage) with currency and experience points.Logistics ManagementMedium sized player garage.Coupled with the driving mechanic of the game is the player's business enterprise. The player chooses a starting location for their headquarters as they create their character. The player is given a tiny, run-down garage to begin their business venture. When starting fresh the player does not have access to a truck and must haul loads using a contracted truck, which lowers the amount of compensation for the haul but allows the player to quick-travel between cities to haul freight.As the player delivers loads and collects currency, the player may then purchase their own truck. This allows the player to make much more money per haul, but also adds more risk and increases the player's travel expenses. Owned trucks must undergo maintenance, be fueled by player currency, and must physically be in the pick-up city to haul a load.Further progression sees the player hire drivers, buy fleets of trucks, and expand their enterprise to multiple garages across Europe.Player ProgressionProgression is handled through a mutual interaction with the business and driving portion of the game. Successfully delivering freight gives the player experience points and currency. The currency can be used to purchase trucks, upgrades, drivers, and garages. Experience points are used to level up. The player gets one skill point per level up that they can put into skills that open up new types of contract options, increase player compensation, or increase fuel economy.World MapSection of the ETS2 world map (incl. Going East! add-on)The base game included 69 cities across 12 European countries: Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.This was further expanded with new expansion packs and game updates:The Going East! add-on expands the map eastward with 13 new cities across the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia, including the Hungarian capital of Budapest and the Polish capital of Warsaw. Two additional cities were added in a later update.The Scandinavia add-on expands the map northward with 26 new cities across Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, including the Danish capital of Kebenhavn, the Norwegian capital of Oslo, and the Swedish capital of Stockholm. One additional city was added in a later update.The Vive la France add-on expands the map westward with 15 new cities across France, along with reworks of the other French cities from the base game (including its capital Paris). Eight additional French cities, including the island of Corsica was added in a later update.The Italia add-on expands the map southward with 19 new cities across Italy, including the Italian capital of Roma, along with reworks of the other Italian cities from the base game. Three additional Italian cities, comprising the island of Sardinia, were added in a later update.The Beyond the Baltic Sea add-on expands the map north-eastward with 24 new major cities (and 11 smaller towns) across the Baltic states (Estonia with its capital Tallinn, Latvia with its capital RÄ«ga, and Lithuania with its capital Vilnius), the southernmost part of Finland (including its capital Helsinki), and some north-western parts of Russia (including the north-western cities of Saint Petersburg and Pskov, and the remote oblast of Kalinigrad).The Road to the Black Sea add-on expands the map south-eastward with 20 new major cities (and 10 smaller towns) across Bulgaria, Romania, and the north-western part of Turkey (sometimes known as East Thrace), including the Bulgarian capital of Sofia, the Romanian capital of BucureÈti, and Istanbul (the most populous city throughout Europe).The Iberia add-on expands the map south-westward, with 49 cities across Portugal and Spain, including the Portuguese capital of Lisboa and the Spanish capital of Madrid. Two additional cities were added in a later update.In addition, Germany received a major re-work between 2018 and 2021. In 2022, Austria also received a major re-work.Trucks and UpgradesThe player begins the game without a truck, but can take out a loan from the bank after a few deliveries to purchase their first truck. When creating a profile, the player chooses their preferred manufacturer. The main showroom for the player's preferred manufacturer is shown on the world map, and the player may instantly visit the showroom to purchase their first truck. As the player travels the world, they will discover more dealers representing different truck manufacturers.The player must visit the showroom to purchase their first five trucks after which they may purchase trucks ""online"" through a menu instead of having to visit the dealer.TrucksThere are seven European truck manufacturers represented in the game (DAF, Iveco, MAN, Mercedes-Benz, Renault, Scania, and Volvo), with the base game having one truck from each manufacturer (other than Renault, who had two). Additional trucks were added post-release, for a total of 18 trucks (as of DAF 2021), as well as new vehicle customization options.DAF XF 105Iveco StralisMAN TGXMercedes-Benz ActrosRenault MagnumRenault PremiumScania R 2009Volvo FH16 2009Iveco Stralis Hi-Way - Added on July 9, 2013.Volvo FH16 2012 - Added on October 24, 2013.Scania Streamline - Added on December 9, 2013.DAF XF Euro 6 - Added on November 11, 2014.Mercedes-Benz New Actros - Added on May 26, 2015.Scania R - Added on December 1, 2017.Scania S - Added on December 1, 2017.MAN TGX Euro 6 - Added on February 8, 2019.Renault T - Added on September 26, 2019.DAF 2021 - Added on June 10, 2021.DAFMANVolvoIvecoScaniaMercedesRenault PremiumRenault MagnumDownloadable ContentMap ExpansionsOther than the ""Going East!"" expansion, all map expansions also add new local industries, cargo types, and Steam achievements.Going East! - Released on September 19, 2013, expanding Czech Republic, Poland, and Slovakia eastward while adding Hungary.

1414720,Desktop Man,399,DesktopMan Team,DesktopMan Team,0,0,0,"Action, Casual, Indie, RPG, Simulation","English, Japanese, Simplified Chinese, Korean",,,"OverviewEach game or round consists of one dungeon floor, randomly created, that you must navigate through, gaining levels until you can defeat the boss. As you move more of the dungeon is revealed, allowing you to find hidden treasure or power ups. Once you have defeated the boss, a score screen is shown and any game rewards are given to you. These rewards include new game modes, classes, or races. There is only a single floor to each dungeon, and no persistent characters from dungeon to dungeon. Long term progression in the game comes in the form of collecting gold and unlocking new game elements, which can open up new strategies.Although the game is heavily informed by roguelike design, each level is akin to a tactical puzzle game. The primary way for the player to regain health and mana is by exploring squares; if one uses up this resource recklessly, it is easily possible to lock oneself out of being able to defeat the level's boss. More difficult levels often require more complex strategies, such as targeting monsters of much higher level than the player, or carefully timing a level up to take best advantage of the free health and mana restoration associated with it.VersionsAfter the initial freeware release of the alpha version in 2010, QFC Design turned their efforts toward an enhanced, full version of the game, which they have rewritten in the Unity Engine. The full version was commercially released in 2013 on PC, Mac, and Linux with iOS and Android ports following.The full version features enhanced graphics and expanded gameplay. It uses a world map with multiple dungeons, and each of these dungeons contain distinguishing features, such as different level layouts and different selections of monsters. This provides a much expanded selection compared to the level types available in the alpha. The player undertakes a series of quests to unlock new dungeons, as well as items, classes, races, altars and other features. Dungeons may now include sub-dungeons, branches that often contain rewards or puzzles. A ""preparation"" system was introduced in the beta, which allows the player to spend gold in exchange for certain advantages at the start of a dungeon run. The preparation system includes item banks, which allow the player to store items they have found and reuse them in later dungeons.Due to extensive rebalancing, some gameplay elements including class abilities and gods now operate quite differently in the full version, compared to their counterparts in the freeware version.AvailabilityThe alpha version of the game is freeware and is currently available for download at desktopdungeons.net.The full version of the game is now available for purchase on Steam and on the the creator's website. The game retails for $14.99 and was officially released on November 7th 2013.RacesNameDescriptionUnlocked at...

1414800,Wet steps,199,Orika Nekoi,Moonworks,0,0,0,Indie,"English, Russian, Ukrainian, Simplified Chinese, Spanish - Spain",,,"OverviewRubi's got firepowerWet is a third person action game developed by A2M and published under Bethesda Softworks. The gameplay is focused on stylized combat in which the main character, Rubi, can perform various acrobatic moves and quick combat maneuvers. Players are able to target multiple targets at once, and maneuver at high speeds. Rubi can run sideways along walls, slide and even jump astonishing heights. WET is an action game along the lines of Devil May Cry or Bayonetta, and has the basic characteristics of shooters like Gears of War or Wanted. The game also allows for hand-to-hand combat and melee attacks, with the use of a sword or grapples.GameplayIt's all about the combos!The action in WET takes place in a few different ways, with a general focus being on obtaining score multipliers by killing waves of enemies. Rubi can shoot like in a normal third person shooter, in which the reticule will fire both weapons she is currently holding, but when she jumps, or slides, shooting will activate a slow motion mode similar to that of Max Payne. In this mode one hand will lock onto an enemy by default, while you can free aim the gun in her other hand to shoot at different targets and pull off head shots.While the game has many instances of normal linear progression, the emphasis for gameplay is placed on ""arena"" sections, in which Rubi is locked into a confined location, and waves of enemies will continually pour in, until Rubi smashes certain objects, preventing enemies from respawning. The player can move through these sections quickly by putting a quick focus on smashing the enemy spawn locations, but the game grades performance in these areas not just on how quickly you pass through, but also on how acrobatic you were, and how many enemies you killed. For getting high ratings at the end of each arena area, the player is rewarded with points that they can use to upgrade Rubi's weapons, or purchase new acrobatic abilitiesAcrobaticsWith a focus reminiscent of the Tony Hawk franchise, the player is encouraged to use acrobatics at nearly all times during the combat heavy portions of the game. Rubi has a vast array of moves she can use, and can also purchase additional upgrades as you progress through the game. Not only can you attain a multiplier by killing enemies while in slow motion, but you can string together successive moves to advance or maintain a score multiplier. For example; Rubi can slow motion shoot while wall running, then jump, keep shooting, and move into a slide, and finish off whatever enemies there are. Initially, high scores are used merely to unlock more abilities for Rubi, but after finishing the campaign, the player can play previous levels in a score challenge mode.Rage ModeRubi is very unhappy.During some areas of the game, Rubi will enter a room, be charged at by a pretty worthless enemy, shoot him square in the head, and get his blood all over her face. This seems to trigger an almost blood lust like state for Rubi, and she will put on her war face, accompanied by blaring sirens. The game shifts dramatically to a more stylized look, and this is known as ""Rage Mode."" While in this mode, the focus shifts from an overall combo multiplier to measure score, and instead measures the player's performance purely on their kill count. The kill count still acts as a combo though, and going too long without dispatching a foe will reset the count. Also much like the combo meter, the higher the player's kill count is, the quicker the meter drains.Rubi doesn't regenerate health in this mode as quickly as she does in the other arena segments, which encourages the player to be far more aggressive with enemies. The player still maintains their acrobatic slow motion abilities though, which is helpful to keep charging enemies at a distance, or for removing large clusters of foes quickly.StoryAs the story begins, Rubi is hired by the son of Mr. Ackers to retrieve a briefcase, which contains a heart that Mr. Ackers needs for an emergency heart transplant. Rubi is successful, and returns to her home in Texas afterward. Some time later, Rubi is approached by Mr. Ackers, to retrieve his son, who he worries has fallen in with a drug cartel in China, and wishes for him to be retrieved, so that he can return to being the heir to the Ackers' drug organization.After a good deal of time searching for him, Rubi locates Ackers' son, and brings him to the man that hired her. The man and his goons kill him, and then turn on Rubi, rather than paying her. Rubi gets away wounded, and sets off to figure out what happened, so that she can exact her revenge. This leads her to London, where she seeks information on Mr. Ackers, where she storms his mansion and kills many of his men, only to figure out the person that hired her was not actually Mr. Ackers.Rubi discovers the man she's looking for is Rupert Pelham, who is trying to take over various drug empires to push his own product. As Rubi finally discovers the identity of her real target, she sets off to blaze a trail of destruction, stopping at nothing until Pelham is dead.WeaponsDual PistolsThe default weapon for Rubi, her modified revolvers never run out of ammo, and are always the best weapons for head shots.KatanaThe sword acts as Rubi's default melee attack, but can be upgraded to be more useful for acrobatic attacks and combos.Dual ShotgunsBest used for enemies with a lot of health, Rubi's shotguns pack a tremendous amount of damage at close range.Dual Sub-Machine GunsFor dealing with large groups of enemies as quickly as possible, Rubi's best bet is her dual SMGs.Dual Explosive-Tipped CrossbowsOne of the more unique weapons for Rubi, her dual crossbows fire explosive-tipped bolts, which detonate on contact.MusicWET's soundtrack boasts featuring both an original score, along with a veritable feast of alt-rock tracks, 35 in total from 20 different bands. The score for the game was recorded over a four day period, and was composed by Brian LeBarton in Los Angeles, featuring an interesting/unusual cast of musicians (such as Carla Azar of the band Autolux). The 'compilation' side to WET's soundtrack features contributions from a plethora of bands and artists, chiefly representing the alternative 'rockabilly' and 'trip hop' music scenes respectively:Knock Gallery West (Undead West, Murder, As We Ride)Long Tall Texans (Adventure, Why Did You Lie To Me?)New Skool Kings (Surf Song)The Chop Tops (El Diablo, Teddy Boy Stomp, Radium Rag)Bert Selen (Western Rock)Creepin' Cadavers (Aquarium, Frankie Dig A Hole)The Gutter Demons (The Offer)Gypsy Pistoleros (Una Para Todo Es Bandido, Switchblade Kiss Comes Close, The Crazy Loco Loquito)Agents Del Futuro (The New Gils)The Arkhams (She's Lost Control, Insane)Three Bad Jacks (Crazy In The Head)The Hypnophonics (Invasion, Romance With A Rapist, Dead Meat, Children Of The Atom, Scream)The Creepshow (Rock N Roll Sweetheart)The Brains (You're Dead)Corpse Show Creeps (El Matador, Rebel Rock)Mushroom Lounge (So Fine In The Sunshine)Brasstronaut (Old World Lies, Requiem For A Scene)Echo Pilot (Three Village Sound Clash)Eliazar (Flyin' By)Notorious MSG (Chinatown Hustler)As you progress through the game, you unlock these songs for sampling in the menus.DevelopmentSierra entertainment was originally publishing Wet, but after Activision all but destroyed Sierra, WET was left in limbo. Bethesda Softworks then picked up the publishing rights, and released the game in September of 2009.E3 Trailer and Bethesda Softworks WebsiteThe trailer of WET shown at E3 2009 and the Bethsoft sub-site for WET portraying the game as an homage to grindhouse films and fighting epics such as Kill BIll, using period music, self-referential humor, and over-the-top action and kills. Players can execute acrobatic moves, ranged combat with a variety of weapons including a modded revolver and a shotgun which can be fired in nearly any direction while navigating terrain, and close fighting with swords and fists. The player character, Rubi Malone, is hired to locate and return the son of her wealthy employer, although things may not be what they first seem.Artificial Mind and Movement WebsiteIn addition to the above information it is revealed on the website of developer Artifical Mind and Movement that Eliza Dushku, star of the television series Dollhouse, will be providing the voice for Rubi Malone.Xbox 360 InstallationThe amount of memory it takes to install this game is 4.3 GB.",,,,,,,,,

Depending on the mode, the goal is primarily to gain supremacy over opponents - either by kills, completing challenges or capturing flags.The game went live for pre-purchase exclusively on Green Man Gaming on 23rd September 2015, and will be released on 2nd October 2015. GameplayThe game is primarily played with a controller, featuring a basic attack button, and the ability to pick up items to use during gameplay. Picking from two different teams (Light or Shadow), players battle each other in arenas covered in light and shadow. Depending on the team that is picked, players can stand still or hold down a button on the controller to turn into the same color as the background. Holding down the button will allow players to sneak and remain hidden, although falling from one platform to another will showsome small telltale signs that players can watch out for. Attacks can take down opponents in a single hit, but if both players attack at the same time, they will parry each other's attacks with no penalty. Items can also be picked up throughout matches, such as caltrops, shurikens and smoke bombs. There are three main modes in the game - Deathmatch, Capture The Flag, and Training. Deathmatch allows you to set the maximum amount of kills required for a team to win, and to include CPU players. Capture The Flag will randomly spawn flags on the map, and when one team 'captures' it, the arena will change to add more of that color.

Capture The Flag will randomly spawn flags on the map, and when one team 'captures' it, the arena will change to add more of that color. Training mode adds a single player element to the game, giving players challenges to complete - such as eliminating an opponent with an item. ",,,,,,,,,

1413870,Shadow Man Remastered,1999,"Nightdive Studios, Acclaim Studios Teesside",Nightdive Studios,905,1059,6,"Action, Adventure","English, French, Italian, German, Spanish - Spain, Portuguese - Brazil",,,"OverviewShadow Man is an action adventure with platforming elements based on the comic book series of the same name. It was developed and published by Acclaim, well know at the time for the Turok series, which also was a comic adaptation.StoryIn the game, players take on the role of Michael LeRoi, a voodoo warrior with supernatural powers. His objective is to stop Legion, a demon from Deadside (where all dead souls go). A demon who asked a serial killer in the 1800 to design a castle in Deadside called Asylum, a place where all killers, thieves, rapists and evil souls could reside. Legion intends to use this structure to build his armies and invade Liveside, the land of the living.In order for Legion to get this serial killer to help, he had to convince him to commit suicide so he could follow him to Deadside. The game takes place in 1999. Many years after the first serial killer was recruited by Legion. By this time, 4 more serial killers have been recruited, and are know as The Five. The Five are Milton Pike, Marco Cruz, Avery Marx, John G. Pierce/Jack The Ripper (who was the architect of Asylum), and Victor Batrachian, who is acting as the leader of The five.GameplayAs Shadow Man, players can travel between Liveside and Deadside. They do so obviously by using a teddy bear as a medium that connects Michael LeRoi to his little brother's dead soul that, of course, is in Deadside. Later on in the game players can use the teddy bear to teleport to places they have already been.The game has LeRoi explore different worlds in search of 120 dark souls. These are needed by Legion to create an immortal army, thus, Shadow Man's objective becomes to get them before Legion does and to stop his plan of invading Liveside, eliminating The Five in the process. As players gain more souls, LeRoi becomes more powerful and can access new areas, meaning the game requires players to do some backtracking.Shadow Man faces different monsters throughout the game and in order defeat them, players will have to make use different weapons. Normal weapons from Liveside like shotguns and handguns, and Deadside weapons like the Shadowgun.Other than different weapons and items, LeRoi also finds reports about the serial killers and other game related events that expand the story beyond what you see in the cutscences. These can then accessed from the item menu.Shadow Man gives players the option to face The Five in any order they want and allows them to go the different worlds (if the players has enough souls) in any order without affecting the story.A Playstation 2 exclusive sequel called Shadow Man: 2econd Coming was released in 2002.",,,,,,,,,

1413970,Fox Girls Never Play Dirty,1999,AVANTGARDE,Kagura Games,0,0,5,"Adventure, Indie, RPG","English, Japanese, Simplified Chinese",,,"OverviewDirty Bomb is a class-based multiplayer shooter focused on attack and defend gameplay. Emphasizing strategy and teamwork. There are multiple classes (mercenaries) to choose from, and each class has a set of characters which further change the equipment and play-style of that class. It is currently in Closed Beta and can be accessed via keys sent from their sign-up page. It was added to Steam on January 6th, 2015, and the Closed Beta will last until January 20th, 2015. The game has currently transitioned to Open Beta on June 2nd, 2015.Dirty Bomb features a gamemode called ""Stop-Watch"" which is similar to other objective-based games, where one team must attack and perform certain objectives in order to win while the other team defends. The difference is that if the objectives are completed, the Defenders have that same amount of time to complete the objective as the attackers or else they lose. This keeps going until a team eventually is unable to beat the last team's time, or they are unable to complete the objective at all.Dirty Bomb's development was partially supported by crowd funding through the developer's website offering immediate access to the game's pre-release alpha and beta testing stages.GameplayDirty Bomb borrows from several distinct FPS games, mostly from Splash Damage's previous games, Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory and Brink. Mobility is that of Wolf:ET, with fast movement and the ability to jump off walls to traverse the map to reach the objective. Gunplay is very unlike Wolf:ET, in that it is beneficial to shoot while on the move. Although Iron Sights are implemented, they do more harm than good, cluttering the screen and reducing the player's movement speed. Each mercenary has a unique skill set (See ""Mercenaries"") and the only resource is time, as using a skill places it on Cooldown. In reminiscence of Wolf:ET, ""Time To Kill"" varies depending on the weapon used and how many headshots are landed unlike Brink in which ""TTK"" was very Call of Duty-esque, taking only a few bullets. Various weapons (sniper rifles) can kill in 1 shot to the head, however others takes up to 4-7 headshots.GamemodesObjectiveAn 8v8 objective-based gamemode, once the Attackers complete an objective, they move on to a different part of the map and are issued a different objective. There are a total of 3 objectives per map currently. Objectives include escorting an EV (Extraction Vehicle) to its destination, hacking or bombing a blockade or a site, and carrying 2 data cores to a terminal. The game ends when the Attackers successfully complete all the objectives or if the Defenders successfully defend the objectives.Stop-WatchA competitive objective-based gamemode. The general basis for Stop-Watch is similar to the Objective gamemode, however teams switch sides at the end of the round and compete for the mot objectives completed or the fastest time in completing all the objectives.ExecutionA fast-paced, single life gamemode. Similar to Search-and-Destroy in Call of Duty, each player has only 1 life, and if they get gibbed (fully downed, grey body) they will have to sit out until the next round starts. The Attackers win by killing all Defenders or successfully blowing a bomb site with C4, and the Defenders win by either killing all Attackers, defusing the C4, or successfully waiting out the round timer. After half of the rounds have been played, sides are switched and Attackers become Defenders and vice versa.Competitive MatchmakingA 5v5 ranked matchmaking gamemode. It is identical to the Stopwatch gamemode, but it is limited to 5v5 and matches players based on their rank. (Currently, the matchmaking is near nonexistent and unranked solo queue players will often match up against a 5-stack of high-level players.)CommunityEvaczoneA community-run organization that scheduled competitive PUGs, scrims, and tournaments back in the Alpha and early Closed Beta phases. Eventually became defunct and replaced by Dirty Cups during the last few Closed Beta phases and the Open Beta.DirtyCups.ggA community-run organization that hosted several weekly tournaments that had the support of Splash Damage. Prior to its closing, Dirty Cups was hosting a month-long League that was to end in a tournament of the top placed teams for a prize of $3,000 generously provided by Splash Damage themselves. On August 8, 2015, 2 of the 3 co-founders mysteriously closed services down possibly due to time restraints and fatigue.DBNation.ggA successor to Dirty Cups after its closing, the community-run organization led by several top players as well as 1 of the co-founders of Dirty Cups has just started to gain traction. With the support of the community, the group successfully ran an invite tournament of the top 16 teams in the game as its first tournament on August 30, 2015.ConceptsDirty Bomb takes concepts and mechanics from various other FPS games. The game has undergone multiple major reworks of its system (besides the core gameplay elements). The inclusion of unique mercenaries lends to a fast-paced game with distinct gameplay from every mercenary.MovementA large emphasis has been made on making movement incredibly smooth and Wolf:ET-esque. That effort has been made in the exclusion of the freerunning aspect in Brink, and instead opts for faster running speed in comparison to Brink, as well as wall jumping to traverse holes in the floor, reach a higher floor, or cross between buildings.LoadoutsEvery mercenary is unique. Each has different skills, weapons, health, and movement speed. Unlike other FPS games, these loadouts are set in place. However, there are alternate loadouts received through a crate and key system (See ""F2P System"") that includes different weapons and perks (passive abilities that range from being able to throw grenades back at enemies or reduced footstep sound by 25%).Class-BasedEach mercenary falls under a category that has a specific role. These roles are Assault, Fire Support, Objective Specialist/Engineer, Medic, and Recon/Sniper. Although each mercenary has different abilities, the general playstyle for those that fall under the same category is unchanged, although they vary on how fast/slow the game becomes.F2P SystemCurrently, there are various forms of a F2P system in the game. For starters, mercenaries are locked, with only 2 of them available to new players permanently at the start (Skyhammer and Aura), and 3 others on rotation, similar to League of Legends. Mercenaries are purchasable with 50,000 in-game credits (with a few only costing 30,000), or with real money.Taking from Counter-Strike: Global Offensive's crate and key system, the game includes alternate loadouts that are received through crates. In a previous version of the game, there were also cosmetic skins for both mercenaries and guns, however this system is currently undergoing a revamp, as cosmetic mercenary skins have been integrated with the loadout system. Cases are purchasable with in-game credits and also randomly drops at a match's conclusion. These cases DO NOT require real money to be opened. There are also real money cases that drops the top 3 card rarities, forgoing the bottom 3 card rarities.Currently, there are 6 obtainable card rarities; Lead, Iron, Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Cobalt.Lead: Has 1 augment slotIron: Has 2 augment slotsBronze: Has 3 augment slotsSilver, Gold, Cobalt: Weapon and character skins.Bronze is the highest tier necessary for game play, as the 3 rarities above Bronze bring nothing other than cosmetics.There is a 7th card rarity that was only available to closed beta testers and players who purchased a Founder's Pack, Obsidian. Splash Damage's current plan for Obsidian cards are to have them obtainable through special events.MercenariesEvery mercenary has a distinct weapon under the categories ofAssault RifleSMGSniper RiflePistolRevolverMeleeThere are currently 15 mercenaries available, with 4 having been removed until further notice.EngineersProxy- Uses a shotgun and SMG.- Can deploy proximity minesFletcher- Uses a shotgun and SMG.- Can throw sticky bombs and manually detonate them.Bushwhacker- Uses an SMG and pistol.- Can set up a sentry turret.

1413990,The Heart of Darkness,1999,BigWednesday,Kagura Games,0,0,7,"Adventure, Indie, RPG","English, Japanese, Simplified Chinese",,,"OverviewHeart of Darkness is an action-adventure platformer developed by Amazing Studio and released in 1998 for PlayStation and Windows-compatible PCs. The game depicts a precocious young boy named Andy who sets off on a fantastic quest to rescue his kidnapped dog Whisky from the shadowy forces of evil.Heart of Darkness was designed by noted French developer Eric Chahi. Similar to Chahi's previous title Out of This World, the gameplay consists exclusively of 2D flip screen platforming with puzzle-solving elements. Heart of Darkness was also one of the first games to feature a fully orchestrated musical score.The game is completely unrelated to the Joseph Conrad novel of the same name.StoryAndy is a young boy with a knack for inventing gadgets and a wild imagination. He is often at odds with his schoolteacher, a domineering old man who punishes Andy for sleeping in class by attempting to lock him inside a cupboard while also teasing Andy about his fear of the dark. Fortunately Andy is saved by the ringing school bell and makes a hasty escape from the classroom, with his teacher furiously shouting that tomorrow's test will cover the solar eclipse scheduled to occur that same afternoon.Andy's faithful dog Whisky meets him at the school's entrance, and the pair hitch a ride on a streetcar to watch the eclipse in a nearby park. As the moment of totality approaches, living shadows materialize and reach out towards the whimpering Whisky before snatching the dog away, leaving Andy and his favorite baseball cap behind.Determined to rescue his canine companion, Andy runs home and clambers up to the treehouse in his backyard where he stores his inventions. He activates his custom-built computer and initiates the startup sequence for a single-seat spacecraft built from scrap parts. Andy also retrieves his homemade plasma cannon just before blasting off for parts unknown.GameplayThis is a 2D side scrolling platform game similar to the original  Prince of Persia, Out of This World, and  Oddworld: Abe's Odyssey. Andy can walk, jump, crawl, climb and swim. He can also use magic to grow trees and attack enemies. Later in the game he can use his plasma gun against shadow creatures. The player must solve puzzles which involve timing the character's movement and using his various abilities to progress through the game. If Andy falls into a pit or is killed by the shadow creatures, the game is over.DevelopmentEric Chahi, the creator of the classic adventure game Out of This World was the creative force behind Heart of Darkness. The game had been in development at Amazing Studio for more than five years and suffered numerous delays before it was finally released in 1998. The development time was mostly spent in creating the game's music and FMVs. Chahi himself would not return to active game development for nearly a decade following Heart of Darkness' release.",,,,,,,,,

The game drops the players into the town of Deadhill, USA where they must use a variety of weaponry to fight off hungry zombies. Players also complete quests that correspond to the game's fantastical plot. This game includes elements of action, role playing, character levelling, crafting weapons, and challenging quests. Bright, comic-style graphics complement the zany characters and insane theme.StoryThe story begins with the town being overrun with zombies and Jack, the Gamer, being hassled by his ex-girlfriend. He even suspects he's in a videogame, and he might not even be the protagonist. Jack has to get through the day and escape the town, but he can't do it by himself. He has to join forces with his ex-girlfriend and anyone else that will help him to survive!CharactersJack, The GamerDefault prefered weapon: ShotgunUtility element: FireRachel, The GirlDefault prefered weapon: UziUtility element: SonicBrian, The GeekDefault prefered weapon: RevolverUtility element: RadiationLuxo, The AlienDefault prefered weapon: Ray GunUtility element: ShockCraftingThe game features a robust crafting system that allows the various weapons to be imbued with four different environmental modifiers, such as fire or radioactivity.

Causes a slight increase in size.Radiation: Occasionally transforms a Zombie into a Mutant.Shock: Zombies are momentarily stunned.Health: Steals health from the zombies.The game also features a number of weapons that can be unlocked throughout the game's progression, with every weapon being able to be imbued with a modifier.ChainsawCricket BatShotgunAssault RifleUziRevolverRay GunSwordThe utility item that each character always has can also be upgraded once to a more effective version of itself. This is done in much the same manner as creating the tool the first time, with the only difference being that you use the more powerful item in the combination.SkillsEach character has four skills that can be upgraded as the player levels up. Skills require that a certain number of points be attributed to them before leveling up. Each character needs a different number of points for each skill, depending on their strengths and weaknesses. Skills may need as low as three points or as many as six to be upgraded. Five points are given upon each level earned.

1413480,Shin Megami Tensei III Nocturne HD Remaster,4999,ATLUS,SEGA,893,839,88,RPG,"English, Japanese, Traditional Chinese, French, Italian, German, Spanish - Spain, Korean",,,"OverviewThe Demi-Fiend.Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne is the third game in the Shin Megami Tensei series. It is known as Shin Megami Tensei: Lucifer's Call in Europe. The release of Nocturne in North America marked something of a turning point for Atlus USA, as it is their first published Megami Tensei title to remain entirely true to the original Japanese version in its localization. The company had previously published a heavily altered version of the original Persona, and while not as drastically changed, elements of their release of Persona 2: Eternal Punishment were edited to maintain continuity with the original game.The game's protagonist, a young man living in Tokyo, becomes caught up in an event called the Conception, in which the world is destroyed so that a new one shall be born in place of it. While most people die when the Conception occurs, the protagonist gains the power of Magatama, turning him into a half-demon, or Demi-Fiend. Thus, he sets out to explore the new world and help protect his friends, who are among the few humans to have also survived.As part of the July 2020 Nintendo Direct Mini, a HD remaster of the game was announced for the Nintendo Switch to be released in Spring 2021.GameplayDemon Negotiation and FusionNegotiating with Baphomet.Nocturne uses the conventions that its predecessors popularized. Primarily those of demon negotiation and fusions. The core of the game lies in conversing with the different demons to try and sway them to join the player's side. To do this, the player may have to try and sweet talk them, bribe them, or in other ways just get lucky in them asking to join the player's party or granting the player gifts. This is easier said than done though as each demon has its own personality, likes, and dislikes that one must learn in order to sway them. Once on the player's side, these demons can be assigned as party members. However, they can also be fused together to create new demons. This process of recruitment and fusion is essential in making progress, and the higher the Demi-Fiend's level, the higher the level of demon he can fuse and control.Fusion takes place at the Cathedral of Shadows. As in other Megami Tensei games, to fuse demons together, the player must select two compatible demons in the current party that are compatible with one another and confirm. The skills a new demon inherits through fusion are randomized and based on the skills known by the demons fused. While at the Cathedral of Shadows, the player may also access the Demon Compendium, which contains a roster of all demons that have been in the player's party and registered. For a fee, the player may summon specific demons from the compendium with the level, stats, and abilities that they had the last time that they were registered.BattleBattle.The battle system is a concept that originated in Nocturne and is referred to as the Press-Turn System. Later Megami Tensei titles such as Digital Devil Saga and Persona 3 use variations of the system as seen in this game. The combat system is predicated around the discovery and exploitation of enemy weaknesses. If the player damages the enemy with an attack type that it's weak against, the player is given another turn in order to deal yet more damage. However, enemies can also do the same to the player's party, and the game ends if the Demi-Fiend falls in battle. Therefore, for the best chance of success, the player must ensure the party's overall vulnerability to specific elements is limited while also maximizing their ability to attack enemy weaknesses.Character ProgressionMagatama select screenThe Demi-Fiend learns new skills as he levels up. The skills learned are determined by the magatama he has equipped at the time the level increase occurs. ""Magatama"" are actually living parasites that are ""equipped"" through ingestion. Additionally, the elemental strengths and weaknesses of the Demi-Fiend are determined by the currently ingested magatama, and each magatama also provides boosts to certain stats for as long as they are equipped. There are a total of twenty-five magatama in the game, each with their own effects. Each magatama is assigned an element or type of attack. For example, when equipped with the physical magatama Marogehra, the Demi-Fiend will learn physical skills such as Counter and Pierce. However, the Demi-Fiend and his demon companions may each only retain a limited number of skills, and once all slots are filled, older skills must be discarded to make way for new ones.PlotChoice of alignment affects the story's outcome.The game begins in modern Tokyo, and is centered around the protagonist and his two friends, Isamu Nitta and Chiaki Hayasaka. They meet up at the Shinjuku Hygenic Hospital in order to visit their teacher, Yuko Takao, at her invitation. However, when they arrive, the three discover the hospital is deserted. As the protagonist explores the hospital's basement, he stumbles upon Hikawa as he prepares for a ritual of some sort when he's rescued by Yuko, who asks that he meet her on the hospital roof. When he arrives, she briefly explains what is about to transpire; the end of the world.Hikawa is the leader of a cult and a devotee of the Scripture of Miroku, and using both the scripture as well as his follower Yuko as a sacrifice, he enacts the Conception; an event in which the world is destroyed and returned to a blank slate. In this world, the Vortex World, a human has the power to give shape to a new world by imbuing it with a philosophy of his or her own design. However, Yuko is not entirely devoted to Hikawa's desires, and thus her invitation to her students was a means to ensure that others would survive the Conception and become potential creators of rival Reasons.Following the Conception, the protagonist is knocked unconscious, and when he is found, he is forced to ingest a parasitic magatama that transforms his core being. No longer fully human, nor fully a demon, he has become what others refer to as the Demi-Fiend; a powerful being that, while unable to create a Reason of his own, has the strength to potentially affect the course of the world to be. As he ventures out into the world, the Demi-Fiend crosses paths with his friends Isamu and Chiaki, whose experiences in the Vortex World cause them to develop Reasons of their own. Isamu comes to desire a world of solitude, where people can live without fear of being interfered with by others, while Chiaki covets a world of chaos, reigning as the strongest in a world full of those weaker than herself.In order for one of these Reasons to fashion a new world, the bearer of that Reason must ascend the Tower of Kagutsuchi and present it to Kagutsuchi. If the bearer can defeat the god in a final trial, the world will be reborn according to the philosophies of the chosen Reason.ReasonsDuring the game, the player is given the opportunity to support a Reason, or the inner philosophy of its founder that will define the laws of the new world. These effectively serve as alignments of Law, Neutrality, and Chaos. The choices made by the player will determine which Reason the Demi-Fiend supports and how the new world is formed.There are three Reasons to choose from:ShijimaThis philosophy emphasizes harmony and stillness. It removes individuality and creates a single collective inner peace that removes desire and chaos. It is conceived by Hikawa.MusubiThis philosophy emphasizes individuality and solitude. In this world, everybody exists separate from each other and would create their own world as they see fit. It is conceived by Isamu.YosugaThis philosophy emphasizes survival of the fittest. In this world, the strongest rule and the weak and useless are purged from existence. It creates never-ending chaos and absolute strife. It is conceived by Chiaki.Other EndingsIt is also possible for the player to either reject all three Reasons, or support more than one. In these instances, an additional three endings are possible.Demon NeutralIn this ending, the Demi-Fiend is seen as apathetic to all Reasons and the future of the world in general. Kagutsuchi is in turn so disgusted with the Demi-Fiend that he leaves, leaving the Vortex World in its current state. As a result, this ending does not feature a final boss.Human NeutralIn this ending, the player has considered the reasons of Shijima, Musubi, and Yosuga, but in the end rejects them all while siding with Yuko. The Demi-Fiend confronts Kagutsuchi with no Reason to bear, and upon his victory, the world is restored to its prior state, as though the Conception never happened.True DemonThis ending can only be acquired if the player completes the Labyrinth of Amala in its entirety. In defeating Kagutsuchi, the Demi-Fiend prevents the world from being reborn and becomes an ally of Lucifer. The game ends with the Demi-Fiend and his demon allies marching onward to a confrontation with the Great Will, YHVH.VersionsDante, as he appears in the international version of Nocturne.Two versions of Nocturne were released in Japan. The initial standard version and the later ""Maniacs Edition"". The Maniacs Edition is what was released in the United States simply as Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne. The additional content is listed below:New opening movieNew dungeon: The Labyrinth of AmalaOptional fights with Fiends, which are a requirement to enter the Kalpas of the labyrinth.A sixth ""True Demon"" ending, accessible to those that finish the game after completing the labyrinth.A bonus for keeping the player's first demon Pixie throughout the entire game without fusing her, or for keeping the fusion result of the Pixie's bloodline in the party for the duration of the game.Dante from Capcom's Devil May Cry series is an enemy and recruitable character.Demons encountered as boss battles are also made available as party members through fusion.A subsequent rerelease of the Maniacs Edition in Japan removed Dante from the game and replaced him with Raidou Kuzunoha and his feline helper, Gouto.",,,,,,,,,

The gamer takes on the role of Taharial, a knight who must take on an unknown evil that has caused madness to spread to his churchâs order and the surrounding townsfolk.The game features:Player to level their own stats through the gameâs levelling systemThe ability to modify weapons and spells through PyresA rich storylineCosmetic changes to the character with different armor and weaponsHidden rooms and secretsUnlockable talents and hidden powers to be found throughout the gameStoryHumanity has always been protected by the Keepers of the Flame, who collectively help contain the Dark Flame, an evil that has poisoned weak-minded humans. Studying ancient texts, the Keepers learned to restrain the Dark Flame, allowing humanity to continue on and avoid destruction. This entity became a secret known only by the elite tiers of Crusaders and the Church, and the rest of the world was kept safe.But a recent occurrence has struck and towns have reported slaughterings, similar to the effects of the Dark Flameâs influence. Taharial, a candidate for the Keepers of the Flame, is sent by the Church and is tasked with protecting the townspeople. He must investigate into the gruesome reports of violence. Meanwhile, Taharialâs brothers have also started to show signs of insanity. A perilous journey faces Taharial and the way is not so well lit.GameplayDark Flame is a 2D Metroidvania-style, action RPG platformer game. The main character, Taharial, uses several weapons to advance through the stages. Different foes will attack Taharial and will respawn upon the character leaving the screen. These enemies also challenge the playerâs timing and precision as they each require a different strategy.As the player progresses through the game, Taharial stats are customizable. A point will be given upon levelling up the character and can be used to boost up either his Strength, Agility, or Intelligence. Strength affects Taharialâs health points and physical attack. Agility improves his physical defence, status resistance, critical hit chance, and subweapon damage. Lastly, Intelligence helps his magic points, element defence, and magic attack.Taharial is able to wield a variety of weapons, which can be found or bought from NPC shopkeepers. These weapons change the attack style, and the amount of damage it can do is influenced by different stats. Asides from his main weapon, he can also carry a subweapon which can be picked up throughout the level. It is a consumable and will be used up.If the player prefers fighting with magic, spells are also found and gained throughout the world. They differ from abilities and powers (below) in which they are influenced by Intelligence and can be leveled up through xp.Abilities and powers are found while exploring the world of Dark Flame. Some will help Taharial to access areas he was unable to previously (for example, double jumping to higher places), and some will alter the playerâs play style (for example, obtaining a shield).The Pyres allows the player to craft new, more powerful spells and weapons, equippable to Taharial. When the player comes across a Pyre, they can use crystals acquired throughout the game to imbue the weapon with dynamic properties. These Pyres can also be used to teleport to one another, bringing Taharial to different locations in the game.There are multiple status effects that a player can encounter in Dark Flame. Several of these effects will be harmful to player. A common one is poison, in which the player will take damage over time. Another would be confusion, which inverts the playerâs controls. These effects have a countdown bar that shows how much longer the effect will last for.A companion is a familiar that can be gained. They come in several forms, but their exact use has yet to be confirmed. They will be helpful in fights.",,,,,,,,,

1413610,Sheep Cutter,0,Tadeas Herentin,Tadeas Herentin,0,0,0,"Casual, Indie, Simulation, Strategy",English,,,"OverviewSheep is a comedic 3D isometric real-time strategy-puzzle game developed by Minds-Eye and published by Empire for the Sony PlayStation and PC in both North America and Europe on November 2000.Players control one of four characters (humans BoPeep and Adam Halfpint, regular dog Motley, and anthropomorphic dog Shep) as they herd semi-autonomous sheep through each level while avoiding deadly obstacles. The PS1 version also supports local two-player multiplayer, where each player herds their team of sheep to push a soccer ball at the opposing player's goal.The premise of the game is that sheep were once intelligent alien beings that became stranded on Earth and left to become domesticated by mankind. Now in the modern day, their ancestors have come to retrieve them (by abducting the main characters to help herd as many of them as they can to Mount Mouflon).Along with a Japanese PS1 release (by Syscom in June 14, 2001), it was also ported to the Mac (released exclusively in North America by Feral on July 2001) and was digitally re-released for the PlayStation Network as a PSOne Classics title in both Europe (on August 14, 2008) and Japan (by GungHo on April 25, 2012).The game also received a handheld port by Capcom for the Game Boy Advance in April-May 2002. Published by Capcom in Japan (as Hitsuji no Kimochi, which loosely translates to ""A Feeling of Sheep"") and by Empire overseas, this port strips all of the bizarre comedic elements while adding a new cutesy art style (with a new playable cast of sheep dogs) and a new ""arranged"" mode (where players level up both their sheep and herder).GameplayWhen starting the game players must choose either easy, medium or hard difficulty and at the start of each level players can choose a herder: Adam Halfpint, BoPeep, Motley or Shep and a breed of sheep: Pastoral, Factoral, Longwool or Neogenetic.Herding sheep in Sheep involves simply running behind them at which point they will start moving in the opposite direction, however they can be highly sensitive to the herder's movements and odd sheep will often stray from the flock. Herders also have a shout to make the sheep quickly scatter in the opposite direction and can pick up and throw individual sheep. The object of each level is to guide the sheep to the end under a time limit, avoiding the obstacles that can kill them along the way. If all of the sheep in a single level die or the time runs out the player fails the level.The sheep themselves have the ability to jump over certain obstacles, stand on switches and knock down impassable bails of hay but levels often also contain cattle grids which only the herder can pass across. Occasionally additional sheep in need of rescue can be found within a level and each level also contains a golden sheep. If the player manages to collect all the golden sheep in a single world they will unlock a sheep-theme minigame at the end of that world. At the end of each level players are scored on how many sheep they saved, how much time was left on the clock when the level finished and bonus points (which can be earned through getting sheep to eat carrots, knock down scarecrows etc.), players also receive an additional bonus if they have safely rescued all of the sheep in the level. Various powerups throughout the game such as a radio which will make sheep follow the player can also be found.",,,,,,,,,

1412010,"Trust Me, Not Her",,,,0,0,0,,,,,"OverviewÂ Â Players navigate the never-ending, procedurally generated levels of the retro-styled NEON DUNJUN in a manner like Pac-Man, only featuring a constantly flowing stream of shots from the front. Â The single screen levels wrap at the edges, and bullets from the player can cause self-inflicted damage, unless the player is towing around theÂ singleÂ key found on each level to block the incoming shots.Â Â The player collects pellets like in Pac-Man, only styled as ""flowers"", until none remain and a locked exit portal spawns onto the level. Â Enemies can also grab the key, even from the player, and force the player to recover the key before they can exit the level. Â If the player lingers too long on a single level, a large and ominous ghost begins to traverse the screen to extinguish the player.Â Â The enemies come in a wide variety of forms and functions, behaving in any manner; from circular ghost-like enemies that wander randomly firing shots, to a behaviors and appearances like the player, to a snake that homes directly to the player, to stationary blobs that fizzle and explode when shot, to enemies that clone into duplicates when shot, and many more. Â Explosions in the game even alter the level geometry, destroying flowers, removing walls, and damaging other enemies. Â In fact, unlike Pac-Man, enemies are just as likely to target other enemies as the player. Â When enemies are destroyed, they spawn groupings of fruit into the level that can be collected by the player. Â Each 100 pieces of fruit collected result in an extra life. Â More rarely, enemies can drop red or green potions that double shooting power and restore health, respectively.Â In addition to single player and split screen two-player, three game modes are available. Â Standard mode challenges the player to travel as deep as possible into the NEON DUNJUN. Â Survival provides only a single life (and prevents additional lives from player behaviors like collecting fruit), challenging the player to make it as far into the dungeon as possible without any second-tries. Â Shuffle mode has the player traverse levels of the dungeon randomly.Â Â Advanced strategies encourage players to take greater risk for higher scores. Â All collectables can be ""chained"", encouraging the player to collect long strings of similar items (flowers or fruit) without engaging enemies or navigating away from danger. Â Premature turning causes the player sprite to ""grind"" along the wall, generating sparks and ""heating up"", which increases player speed and even provides temporary invulnerability. Â Charging the player too much with the grinding mechanic causes the player to explode.Â Â PC and Mac versionÂ Â On August 26th 2011, the developer released a PC/Mac version of the game for free. It's available for download here.",,,,,,,,,

It was developed by Interactive Designs and published by Sega. A Game Gear version of the title was released subsequently.StoryGreendog, a surfer dude, was surfing in the Caribbean islands when an unusually large wave wipes him out. He emerges from the water with a mysterious golden pendant wrapped around his neck, one that cannot be removed. Greendog's bikini clad surfer girlfriend Bambi observes the scene from nearby, and explains to our hero that he must now traverse six different islands in order to obtain six lost pieces of an Aztec treasure if he intends on lifting the curse. Unfortunately, the curse turns everyone he comes in contact with against him in his quest. Greendog is also unable to surf until he removes the necklace.After his grueling journey across the islands comes to a close, Greendog lifts his curse using the surfboard of the Ancients. He then surfs the night sky, while Bambi watches from ashore. She is happy yet aware that the treasure's true power has yet to be unleashed, and Greendog's story has only just begun. No follow-up to Greendog was ever produced.GameplayA surfer dude that has seen better daysThe game plays much like other 16-bit side scrolling platformers and is remembered more fondly for its setting and character than its control. His main weapon is a Frisbee, which is used for both long and short range attacks. Levels contain an area of location based side scrolling, followed by Aztec temples that hold dangerous terrain and puzzles. Greendog will then ride his cart copter in order to travel between islands. On some levels, such as Grenada or Jamaica, Greendog gets to travel by either skateboarding or rollerblading.Health items drop frequently in the form of fast food items and desserts. Special items such as the ability to temporarily stop time or equip Greendog with an umbrella hat are often found as well. Collecting both increases the overall score for the player, which is constantly displayed in the game's HUD along with damage, lives remaining, and up to four queued special items.Greendog's soundtrack features a dynamic mix of Calypso and Caribbean themes.The six islands in the game include:Grenada (Jungle)Mustique (Beach)Curacao (Underwater)Jamaica (City)Saba (Native Village)St. Vincent (Cave)",,,,,,,,,

In order to get elected, BunnyLord and his campaign staff (known as the ""BunnyLord Fun Club"") arm themselves to the teeth and systematically tear down three of the most vicious crime lords in the city, believing that doing so will convince voters that voting for BunnyLord will eliminate crime.CharactersBunnyLordA large, purple, rabbit-like person who is running for mayor. Often seen drinking milkshakes at Aunt Ruby's Diner in-between jobs. Has a personal teleportation device and a BunnyVan or BunnyCopter when he needs to get in or out quickly. Unlike other characters, speaks only in an unintelligible warbling tone, though everyone in-game can understand his words perfectly.BunnyLord Fun ClubThe campaign staff for BunnyLord's mayoral campaign that happens to double as a group of heavily-armed mercenaries.Steve: Campaign Manager, head pollster, the starting character. Wields a very accurate pistol.Cletus: Country boy who talks in a heavy Glaswegian accent. Carries a shotgun that can knock doors off their hinges. Can fire before finished fully reloading.Samantha: A Welsh lady who can reload and fire her pistol while moving, though doing so will reduce accuracy a bit.Jesus (pronounced ""Hey-Zoos""): Sexy Spaniard who will dry-hump anything. Wields an SMG he can fire while sliding.Mike: Alcoholic hitman with a sawn-off shotgun that carries only two slugs. However, Mike can do silent executions that use no ammo and moves faster than other characters.Stanley: He's never voted and has no clue what the election's about, but he has lots of experience working with a paramilitary group. His rifle has the largest capacity and can fill a hallway with bullets in seconds. Slow moving and reloading.Clive: A classy British gent who acts like a John Woo film character, holding pistols akimbo and can shoot in both directions at once with his special attack. The tradeoff is that he cannot hold any explosives. Always seen smoking a cigarette.Ronald Justice: BunnyLord's campaign lacks the funds to hire a real superhero, so he found the next best thing: a crazy man in a cheap superhero costume. On top of a standard pistol, Ronald's unique special attack makes him dash forward and kill foes with his ""magic"" hammer. The hammer can be recharged by performing executions or picking up explosive crates in the level. Also, Ronald can knock doors off their hinges just by sliding through them.Kimmy: A former Master-Ronin-Ninja-Samurai-Yakuza, Kimmy carries a sword in one hand that can instantly kill almost any enemy as her special attack. Like Ronald, she can also recharge her sword by performing executions or picking up explosive crates. In her other hand, she wields a SMG that can be fired even while performing executions, though she is very inaccurate with this weapon.CriminalsBogdan Nabatov: Russian mobster who has made ""Vodkaville"" his home.Upgraydd (a.k.a. ""Darren""): Name is in reference to a minor character from the movie ""Idiocracy."" Ruthless druglord holed up in the projects of Bredrin Park where his gang grows and sells ganja.
