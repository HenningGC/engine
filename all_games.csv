It was rebuilt by <a href=""//www.giantbomb.com/magma-fortress/3010-9547/"" data-ref-id=""3010-9547"">Magma Fortress</a> for Android and iOS with new art, sound, abilities and achievements. With a goal to retrieve the Fleece of Yendor from the 16th floor, players descend a dungeon filled with demons and wizards. Every death restarts the player at the beginning of the game, and every floor is randomized. Most floors have Altars where players can pray to Apollo, Hermes, Athena and other gods to either regain health or gain ability upgrades, like throwing the spear further or regaining energy with each kill. </p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Both the player and the enemies can only move once per turn, and moving is the main form of attacking for most units. The basic form of attack, the stab, is done by moving adjacent to an enemy.</p><p>Having a spear allows the player to lunge by moving directly towards the enemy (being adjacent doesn't count). Alternatively, players can throw the spear by selecting the item in the bottom right hand corner and choosing a target. Players will need to retrieve it unless they have a special ability.</p><p>Leaping costs 50 energy (players gain 10 for moving adjacent an enemy) and it can be combined with other abilities.</p><p>Players also have a shield, which can be used to bash enemies or bombs one space away in the direction that the player character is facing.</p><p>Players can pray at altars to upgrade their abilities, however, this will remove access to a score bonus. More upgrades can be unlocked by completing Achievements.</p><p>Once the Fleece of Yendor is retrieved from Depth 16, players can either return to the surface via a portal to end the game, or continue descending to increase their score. When wearing the fleece you regenerate 1 health whenever you descend a floor. </p><p> </p><h2>Abilities &amp; Upgrades</h2><p>Players can pray at the Altars they find. Praying allows them to refill Health or select one of the following options. Note that players can pray during combat, but it does cost one turn. Many abilities require Sacrifice, which reduces the maximum health by 1, 2 or 3.</p><p>Keep in mind: there are no altars beyond Depth 15. Should descend beyond where the fleece is kept, you do so with no more prayers.</p><h3>Health</h3><p>Players begin with 3 health and take 1 damage from any enemy attack.

1480270,Sethtek Driving Simulator Playtest,0,,,0,0,0,,,,"<p>Dangerous Driving is an arcade racing game in the same vein as the Burnout series. The game consists of a handful of different environments broken up into circuits and point to point races and numerous types of cars to drive during events. Game types include standard races, road rage, time attack, and pursuit. Game mechanics are essentially identical to the Burnout games; players build boost by drifting, driving in oncoming traffic, near misses, jumps, and takedowns. Cars will crash if they hit a road car or a piece of the environment, and for a short period of time after a crash the player is able to enter an aftertouch window and attempt to hit another player car with limited movement.</p><h2>Environments</h2><p>The game features 7 unique locations inspired by national parks in North America. These locations provide the game's combined 31 courses with over 270 miles of road.</p><ul><li>Twin Ferry Lakes</li><li>Dead Rock Canyon</li><li>Surfside Island</li><li>Eagle Ridge Mountain</li><li>High Dunes Desert</li><li>Grasslands Proving Ground</li><li>Cool Water Valley</li></ul><h2>Game Modes</h2><p>At launch the single player mode will have 69 (nice) events made up from the 9 different event types. New cars are unlocked by progressing through the single player.</p><h3>Race</h3><p>The standard event type in Dangerous Driving. A race against 5 computer controller vehicles with Takedowns and Aftertouch active.</p><h3>Heatwave</h3><p>A more pure race mode where Takedowns are not active, and completely using the boost bar will trigger a ""Heatwave""; an automatic refill of the boost bar allowing for chaining of boosts. Think of this as the Burnout 1/2 mode.</p><h3>Face Off</h3><p>A one on one event with a rival vehicle. Take them down, win the race, and win their car!</p><h3>Shakedown</h3><p>A pure time trial mode with players racing against the clock to get the best time possible. These events will also serve as a preview for cars yet unlocked.</p><h3>Eliminator</h3><p>A five lap race in which last place is eliminated every lap.</p><h3>GP</h3><p>A three race series in which points are earned and the champion is determined at the end. There is a GP series for every Class of vehicle.</p><h3>Survival</h3><p>A combination of time trial and checkpoint racing. The longer a player goes the tighter the window for the next checkpoint will be and traffic will become heavier.</p><h3>Pursuit</h3><p>Play as a cop and takedown the bad guys before they escape!</p><h3>Road Rage</h3><p>Get as many Takedowns as possible before time runs out.</p><h2>Vehicles</h2><p>Dangerous Driving technically has 27 vehicles across six different classes. That being said, it appears as though there are really only six unique car models, corresponding to the classes, that are then tuned and modified for every variant.</p><h3>Classes</h3><ul><li>Sedan</li><li>SUV</li><li>Coupe</li><li>Supercar</li><li>Hypercar</li><li>Formula DD</li></ul><h3>Variants</h3><ul><li>Base - The one you start each class of events with.</li><li>Advanced - Stronger versions that made for Takedowns and Road Rage.</li><li>Tuned - Faster cars tuned for Heatwave events that earn boost faster, and gain 2 MPH to their top speed after every Heatwave.</li><li>Prototype - Optimized for racing, these vehicles are tuned to be faster but more fragile.</li><li>Cop Cars - Sedan, SUV, and Supercar cop cars for all of your pursuit needs.</li></ul>",,,,,,,,,

As with many co-op games, Spare Parts can be played either locally on the same console or online. There are ""co-op only"" abilities and interactions that are only available to two players, giving an strong incentive to experience the game with another player. However, the game can still be played single-player, but unlike most co-op oriented games, it will not feature an AI companion. If players do choose to play cooperatively, they can receive bonuses for simultaneously combining and using certain weapons.</p><p>In addition to Mar-T and Chip, other robots have crash-landed or been abandoned on the planet. The players can choose to rescue and repair these robots and unlock them as playable characters.</p><h4>Server Shutdown</h4><p>On April 13th 2012, only 15 months after the game was released, the online servers for the game were shut down. No online co-op play was possible after this, although owners of the game can still play co-op locally.</p>",,,,,,,,,
