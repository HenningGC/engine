Originally having started development as a Wii-title, Underground later shifted to Wii U when the market transitioned over.The game has players guide the robot Sari through dangerous mines and caves by building bridges, stairs and other things. These tools can be built by collecting resources from destroyed buildings found in the environments. Later in the game players will also have to fend off bugs and other creatures endangering Sari. All this is done by using laparoscopic devices in-game that resemble those used by surgeons in real life.The game will support a unique controller based developed by Pezy on real laparoscopic equipment but utilizing two Wii Remotes and Nunchuks that act like laparoscopic graspers and a base plate resembling two trocar sites. According to developer Grendel Games, this will “subconsciously train [the player's] basic laparoscopic skills, such as depth perception, eye-hand coordination, inverse movements and bi-manual dexterity.” Alternatively, the analog sticks on the Wii U GamePad can be used to control the game, if one does not wish to purchase the special controller.Underground will release as a Wii U eShop title and cost between €20-30 and the controller is said to be offered at an affordable price point far below that of typical learning tool equivalents (normally valued at about €200).

Ultimate (known in Japan as Dairantou Smash Brothers SPECIAL, loosely translated to ""Great Melee Smash Brothers Special"") is a 2.5D crossover platformer-fighting game developed by both Bandai Namco and Sora and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Switch worldwide on December 7, 2018.The fifth installment of the Super Smash Bros. series (and the sequel to Super Smash Bros. for Wii U / Nintendo 3DS), Ultimate features the largest roster to date (including all characters and stages from all previous games in the series), with over 100 stages (and their Omega and new Battlefield variants) playable and over 800 songs in its soundtrack.The game includes numerous gameplay and aesthetic changes (including updated UI, the ability to disable stage hazards, music tracks being organized by series rather than by stage, and an optional Final Smash meter that fills over time), along with new bonus game modes, a new single-player campaign mode (with the new ""Spirits"" system), and updated online matchmaking. The Character Customization feature of the previous game has been removed (with the exception of Mii Fighters, who now have a more limited version of the feature).This game's version of Adventure Mode, also called ""World of Light"", involves a mysterious being named Galeem using the power of the Master Hand to consume the universe and rebuild it under its image (the ""World of Light""). Other than the sole survivor (Kirby), all of the universe's inhabitants have been turned into ""Spirits"", who have been forced to puppet clones of the universe's strongest fighters (who have been put on stasis).CharactersThe unlocked roster (excluding DLC).The game's base roster includes 72 playable characters (76 if counting all three Pokémon Trainer characters and all three Mii Fighter variants as separate characters). More will be added as downloadable content.All playable characters from the series' history have returned, with Charizard reverted to being part of Pokémon Trainer. In addition, the game includes new characters (including some from Konami's Castlevania series and Atlus's Persona series) and a new classification of characters: Echo Fighters. Building upon the ""clone character"" concept from previous games, Echo Fighters have most of the same moves and properties as other characters (for example, Dark Pit is now classified as an Echo Fighter to Pit).Unlike previous games of the series, Ultimate has most of the characters locked from the start (with the original 8 unlocked). Players can unlock new characters by either playing VS. matches, by clearing Classic Mode with other characters, or by encountering them in Adventure Mode. Mii Fighters are unique in that they are only unlocked by creating them in the Create Mii Fighters mode.New AdditionsInkling (Splatoon) - The outfits and gender can be changed using alternate costumes.Ridley (Metroid) - Previously an unplayable boss in Super Smash Bros.

Ultimate is very similar to previous entries. Players fight with a variety of basic and special moves in order to build up the opponent's damage and send them off the screen. Final Smashes return as each character's most devastating attack. Some have been modified to be more cinematic and quicker. Instead of using the Smash Ball item, players can opt for weaker Final Smashes that charge over time.SmashThe standard, traditional game mode. Up to eight players can fight together in free-for-all battles or on teams with a suite of options for rule customization.When playing this mode, players now select their preferred ruleset, then the stage, and finally their characters.Special SmashPlayers fight with special modifiers to their fighters.TourneyUp to 32 players compete in a tournament bracket automatically created by the game.Squad StrikeA 5-on-5 or 3-on-3 showdown. Players use consecutive fighters in an elimination style mode. When one fighter is KO'd, the next one takes its place.SmashdownEach fighter can only be used once before they are no longer selectable for future battles.ClassicThe original single-player mode. Each character has a set, themed sequence of fights leading to the boss, unlike previous entries where Classic Mode was randomized and always ended with a battle against Master Hand.Rulesets are also variable between characters- for example, Ryu's classic mode features only 1-on-1 stamina matches to evoke the Street Fighter series.Mob SmashThe incarnation of Multi-Man Smash from past games. This is also where the All-Star Mode of this game lies - all currently available fighters will spawn endlessly.TrainingAn improved version of the training mode that now shows more technical data for moves.ChallengesIn-game achievements that offer various rewards on completion.SpiritsSpirits each give special effects during gameplay.Spirits mode takes aspects of trophies, custom moves, events and stickers from past games. Hundreds of spirits representing characters from Nintendo games (and the third-party franchises) can be collected and used to boost the abilities of fighters. Spirits have rarity levels, and can give additional buffs when equipped. They can also be leveled up, combined, and sent on expeditions.To earn a spirit, players fight a match that is intended to invoke some aspects of the spirit's personality. This can include COM behavior, items, and other special effects. For example, the Guts Man spirit pits the player against a giant Mega Man who uses throw moves often.Spirits can also be used in battles with other players.Adventure Mode - World of LightIntroduction to World of LightWhile Ultimate's adventure mode has much less story than Brawl's Subspace Emissary, it still has some context as to why everyone became spirits. A godlike being, using an army of Master Hands, attacks the world. The smash fighters are unable to stop it, and they, along with the rest of the universe, lose their physical forms and become spirits. Only Kirby manages to escape, and finds himself in a new world where the other fighters have once again been corrupted.In the game mode, players travel through several overworld maps fighting battles to reclaim spirits. Those spirits can be used to progress and explore more of the map. When a player wins a battle against a puppet fighter, that fighter is unlocked and joins the team. The mode goes through several locales, including outer space.Online PlayThe simplified online menuOnline battles return with some notable changes. Matchmaking is no longer separated into ""For Fun"" and ""For Glory"" modes. Instead, players select their preferred rules for matches. The game will attempt to match players with similar settings. Matchmaking is also determined in part by Global Smash Power, a number representing how good the player is.Once a player has a high enough Global Smash Power, they can play Elite Smash, a place where the best of the best can fight. The results of these battles will impact balance changes to the game made in the future.Players can also make online tags, and earn the tags of opponents they beat. Other options include spectating matches, forming a two-player team, and creating online lobbies where they can set the rules and play with friends.StagesFinal Destination's newest incarnationSuper Smash Bros. Ultimate contains 103 stages from gaming history, most of them returning from previous games. Each stage can be reconfigured into layouts resembling Final Destination and Battlefield, for close to 300 possibilities overall. Even Masahiro Sakurai admitted ""we must be crazy"" to include so many stages.For stages from the original Super Smash Bros., the team wanted to preserve the feeling of nostalgic 64-bit visuals and sound. For all other stages, the environments have been vastly overhauled for modern graphics and lighting.Stages are also listed in the order they first appeared in the series. However, in a series first, every stage is unlocked from the beginning, and each supports up to eight player battles. Players can also activate a Stage Morph feature, where any two stages can transition between each other.Each DLC character (other than Piranha Plant) comes bundled with an additional stage and accompanying music.New StagesStage NameOriginBattlefieldSuper Smash Bros.

Ultimate also sees the return of Assist Trophies and Poké balls, items that summon another character to aid the player who used it. The roster of possible characters has also grown from past games, with 55 Pokémon and 59 Assist Trophies. Assist Trophies can now be KO'd, which adds a point to the score of the player who did so. As always, these items and the many others in the game can be turned off at will.Assist TrophiesNameFranchiseAkiraVirtua FighterAlucardCastlevaniaAndrossStar FoxArcade BunnyNintendo Badge ArcadeAshleyWarioWareBlack KnightFire EmblemBombermanBombermanBurrowing SnagretPikminChain ChompSuper MarioChef KawasakiKirbyColor TV-Game 15Color TV-GameDevilDevil WorldDillonDillon's Rolling WesternDr. KawashimaBrain AgeDr. WrightSimCityFlies & HandMario PaintGhirahimThe Legend of ZeldaGhostsPac-ManGray FoxMetal GearGuileStreet FighterHammer BroSuper MarioIsaacGolden SunJeffEarthboundKapp'nAnimal CrossingKnuckle JoeKirbyKnucklesSonic the HedgehogKlaptrapDonkey KongKrystalStar FoxLynFire EmblemMetroidMetroidMidnaThe Legend of ZeldaMoonThe Legend of ZeldaMother BrainMetroidNightmareKirbyNikkiSwapnotenintendogNintendogsPhosphoraKid IcarusPrince of SabléKaeru no Tame ni Kane wa NaruRathalosMonster HunterRikiXenoblade ChroniclesRodinBayonettaSamurai GorohF-ZeroShadowSonic the HedgehogSheriffSheriffShovel KnightShovel KnightSkull KidThe Legend of ZeldaSpring ManARMSStarfyStarfyStarmanEarthboundSukaponJoy Mecha FightSquid SistersSplatoonTakamaruThe Mysterious Murasame CastleThwompSuper MarioTikiFire EmblemVinceArt AcademyWaluigiSuper MarioWily CapsuleMega ManYuri KozukataFatal FrameZeroMega ManMusicSuper Smash Bros. Ultimate makes history with over 800 music tracks (around 28 hours) available to listen while playing the game. The My Music function returns, allowing players to adjust how often individual songs play on each stage. In past games, each stage had its own exclusive group of songs. In Ultimate, however, a stage can play any track from its own franchise.The game also contains a sort of music player for the songs in game. Music can be organized into custom playlists. Players can then listen to music with earbuds when the Switch is in sleep mode. Despite the astronomical amount of music in Ultimate, Sakurai remarked that compression technology has advanced so that music only takes up a fourth of the space it did in the previous game.Notably, the music staff was given nearly free reign to arrange whatever franchises they chose. As a result, Castlevania and Mega Man have many new songs, while franchises like WarioWare and Bayonetta were not so lucky. Final Fantasy's music is still limited to two songs ripped from Final Fantasy VII, likely due to rights complications.Additional music is included in the DLC packs.New Original MusicLifelight (JP)LifelightMenuBattlefieldFinal DestinationMob SmashClassic Mode: MuralClassic Mode: DefeatClassic Mode: Final ResultsClassic Mode: Bonus StageMaster HandCrazy HandMaster Hand / Crazy HandThe Light Realm: PrologueThe Light Realm: MarchThe Light Realm: BaseThe Dark RealmThe Dark Realm: Mysterious SpaceThe Final BattleThe Final Battle: After the TransformationGaleemDharkonGaleem / DharkonMain Theme Piano SoloFree the Spirit!Spirits: CollectionSpirits: Inventory/ItemsTourney: Battle ListTourney: Winner AnnouncementTrainingVaultShopPractice FightsSpectateNew ArrangementsSuper Smash Bros. series:How to Play - Super Smash Bros.

Up to three players, after selecting their character from a pool of six, take on many opponents and hazards across a handful of 2D stages, each of which concludes with a boss. Each of the six characters have different strengths and weaknesses. Each character has a health bar and a soul bar; the soul bar can be drawn from if the health bar is emptied or the player falls into a pit. Only when the soul bar is empty does the character become permanently dead. If a character perishes, they remain dead for the rest of the playthrough and this affects the ending the player receives. If there are fewer alive characters than players, they take over a small creature called ""Kyubey"" that can't be killed but can't affect the world either, though can be used as a distraction.",,2011-08-13,,,,,,,

Originally having started development as a Wii-title, Underground later shifted to Wii U when the market transitioned over.The game has players guide the robot Sari through dangerous mines and caves by building bridges, stairs and other things. These tools can be built by collecting resources from destroyed buildings found in the environments. Later in the game players will also have to fend off bugs and other creatures endangering Sari. All this is done by using laparoscopic devices in-game that resemble those used by surgeons in real life.The game will support a unique controller based developed by Pezy on real laparoscopic equipment but utilizing two Wii Remotes and Nunchuks that act like laparoscopic graspers and a base plate resembling two trocar sites. According to developer Grendel Games, this will “subconsciously train [the player's] basic laparoscopic skills, such as depth perception, eye-hand coordination, inverse movements and bi-manual dexterity.” Alternatively, the analog sticks on the Wii U GamePad can be used to control the game, if one does not wish to purchase the special controller.Underground will release as a Wii U eShop title and cost between €20-30 and the controller is said to be offered at an affordable price point far below that of typical learning tool equivalents (normally valued at about €200).

Tank! Tank! is a third-person vehicular combat game developed and released by Namco Bandai for arcades in late 2009 (October in Japan, December in North America).A spiritual sequel to the 1995 Namco arcade game Tokyo Wars, Tank! Tank! Tank! pits four players (human or A.I.) against each-other as quick-moving combat tanks in wide-open destructible arenas. Along with a variety of weapon power-ups (from a standard Machine Gun to the single-use Colossus Missile), the game features an optional co-operative mode where players fight a variety of giant monsters. The dedicated sit-down arcade machines (which are linked together) feature heavy use of force feedback and ""NAM-CAM"" camera support (for player avatars, previously a feature in the Mario Kart Arcade GP series).The game was later ported to the Wii U and released in two forms: one as a complete retail release and one as a downloadable free-to-play release (with DLC for levels and game modes). Along with local split-screen multiplayer for up to four players (with one player using the Wii U Gamepad), this version adds new maps, tank types, and game modes (including a Story Mode and an asymmetrical multiplayer mode using the Gamepad).The retail release was a launch title for the Wii U in North America and Europe (November 18, 2012 and November 30, 2012, respectfully), with the downloadable version released in early 2013. The Japanese version swapped release dates, with the downloadable version released on December 26, 2012 and the retail version in February 21, 2013.GameplayMultiplayer Gameplay.Each player controls a tank and can compete in 3 different game modes. Players control their tanks using a steering wheel and forward and reverse pedals. Both the seat and the steering wheel shake when firing a shot or being struck by one. The game includes multiple power ups for your tank, including the Plasma Bolt, Machine Gun, Missile Rack, Colossus Missile, and Mega-Beam. Before the start of each match, each player can have their picture taken by a camera included with the cabinet or the Wii U gamepad and choose one of many different costume overlays to include with it.ModesCo-op: All players work together to take down a series of giant monsters, culminating in a battle against King Ghidora-esque 3 headed robot dragon.Free-for-All: Players fight against each other in one of two different settings. The player who destroys the most tanks during the time limit wins.Team Battle: Players split up into two different teams and fight for supremacy.My Kong ( Wii U Only ): One player takes control of a large gorilla monster via use of the Gamepad while up to 3 other players using the standard tank attempt to destroy them.Wii UThe Wii U version of the game is played with the Wii U gamepad and Wii remotes. Tanks are controlled with the Wii remote. Players hold the remote horizontally in their hands, using the directional pad to move their tank around while hitting A to fire. Players lock on to their targets and can destroy the environment to dig up upgrades that increase their fire power or armor.In multiplayer, one player uses the Wii U gamepad to control the level's boss. The player uses the controller's screen to control their character and can tap the screen to unleash powerful attacks such as devastating stomps and barrages of missiles. The front facing camera of the controller lets players put their face into the game as the boss's face.",,2009-10-05,,,,,,,
